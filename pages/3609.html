Each sensor RF transmission contains its own unique identification (ID) code that must be learned into the RCDLR memory. Once all 4 IDs have been learned and vehicle speed is greater than 40 kph (25 mph), the RCDLR continuously compares IDs in received transmission to its learned IDs to determine if all 4 sensors are present. If the remote control door lock receiver (RCDLR) detects a low tire pressure condition or a malfunction in the system, it will send a serial data message to the instrument panel cluster (IPC) requesting tire pressure monitor indicator icon illumination and to display a data message on the driver information center (DIC), if equipped.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Some aftermarket wheel valve stem holes are located further from the wheel rim than original equipment <a href="3624.html">wheels</a>. When using the TPM special tool to activate a sensor, ensure the tool antenna is no further than 15 cm (6 in) from the sensor and is aiming upward. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Aftermarket wheel value stem locations can cause a sensor to not function correctly.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A sensor may have been damaged due to a previous wheel/tire service or flat tire event.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The use of tire sealants can obstruct the sensor pressure sensing port and cause inaccurate tire pressure readings. If this condition is verified, remove the sealer from the tire and replace the sensor. Refer to Tire Pressure Indicator Sensor Replacement (Snap In Style)  (<a href="7918.html">Tire Pressure Indicator Sensor Replacement (Snap In Style)</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Occasionally sensor transmissions are not received by the RCDLR due to vehicle level RF interference from items such as but not limited to aftermarket ignition systems, DVD players, CB radios, or metallic type window tinting. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The sensor activation procedure may have to be repeated up to 3 times before determining a sensor is malfunctioning. In the event a particular sensor's information is displayed on the special tool upon activation but the horn does not chirp, it may be necessary to rotate the wheel valve stem to a different position due to the RF signal is being blocked by another component.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Occasionally sensors can become mislocated due to previous tire rotations where the sensor learn procedure was not performed or stray sensor transmissions have been received from other vehicles . Always learn the sensors to ensure the DTC set is for that actual physical corner of the vehicle.
