This diagnostic also addresses if the ECM is not programmed.<br><br><br>The ECM monitors its ability to read and write to the memory. It also monitors a timing function. The ECM and the TAC processors are used to monitor the TAC system data. Both processors monitor the other processors data to verify that the indicated APP calculation is correct. The ECM performs an intrusive test in order to confirm that the APP signals are not shorted together. The ECM accomplishes this by pulling the APP sensor 2 low momentarily and looking for sensor 1 to also be pulled low.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><br><b>P0601, P0603</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is in Run or Crank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system voltage is more than 5 volts.<br><br><br><br><b>P0602</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is in Run or Crank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The controller is identified as a service replacement ECM.<br><br><br><b>P0604, P062F</b><br><br>The ignition switch is in Run or Crank.<br><br><br><b>P0606</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is in Run or Crank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>During test function after key off before the control module powers down.<br><br><br><br><b>P0607</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is in Unlock, Accessory, Run or Crank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system voltage is more than 5.23 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0601, P0602, P0603, P0604, P0606, P0607, P062F, P0641, P0651, P2610 are not set<br><br><br><br><b>P060D</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is in Run or Crank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system voltage is more than 5 volts.<br><br><br><br><b>P2610</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is in the OFF position for at least 1.6 seconds.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A low battery voltage or a battery disconnect condition has not taken place.
