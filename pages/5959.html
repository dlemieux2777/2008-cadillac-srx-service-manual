<h1>Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Relay Testing</h1><br><br><b>PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD (PCB) RELAY TESTING</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/798670457.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>Many electrical centers (also called Bussed Electrical Centers or BECs) use Printed Circuit Board (PCB) relays. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/798693985.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>The PCB relay is integrally soldered to the printed circuit board; it is not plugged in.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>Printed circuit board (PCB) relays are an integral part of the bussed electrical center or <a href="2926.html">fuse block</a> and cannot be repaired or replaced.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>If any PCB relay needs to be repaired or replaced the bussed electrical center or <a href="2926.html">fuse block</a> must be replaced.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>PCB relays can be identified using the <a href="2926.html">fuse block</a> label on most vehicles.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>Because the PCB relay is compact, it helps electrical engineers reduce the size and mass of the Bussed Electrical Center.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>In the past, you could either feel or hear the "click" of an older style relay, as you operated the circuit it was controlling. You could often use a scan tool or operate the circuit to verify that the relay was operating.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>Due to the location and size of the PCB relays, it may not be possible to hear or feel them operate, so another method has been developed to diagnose them.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>The component technical specification (CTS) of the Bussed Electrical Center requires that if a fuse is used with a relay, the fuse must be downstream of the switched contacts of the relay.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/798736486.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>Depending on the operation of the circuit, the relay contacts will open or close, and voltage will be either present or not present at the fuse. A test lamp can be used to verify this change by touching the small metal portion on top of the fuse.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/798762373.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>If the circuit is protected in some way other than with a fuse, a test point is placed in the BEC for use with a test lamp. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/798791035.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>The test point is called out on the Bussed Electrical Center cover. Test procedures are written to use either the fuse or test point as a diagnostic location.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span><b>TIP:</b> If necessary, carefully move the test lamp probe around in the opening to get a good connection with the test point.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span><b>TIP:</b> Using the prescribed fuse or test point as a diagnostic location, it is possible to diagnose the operation of PCB relays without removing the Bussed Electrical Center from its mounting place.<br><br><br></div>
