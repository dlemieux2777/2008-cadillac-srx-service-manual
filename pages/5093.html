Reviewing this information will help you determine whether the condition described by the customer is a potential operating characteristic or not.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Refer to the following:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Vibration Theory and Terminology  (<a href="5085.html">Vibration Theory and Terminology</a>)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Electronic Vibration Analyzer (EVA) Description and Operation  (<a href="5086.html">Electronic Vibration Analyzer (EVA) Description and Operation</a>)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Vibrate Software Description and Operation  (<a href="5087.html">Vibrate Software Description and Operation</a>)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Reed Tachometer Description  (<a href="5088.html">Reed Tachometer Description</a>)<br><br><br><br><br><b>Vibration Diagnostic Process</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Using the following steps of the vibration diagnostic process will help you to effectively narrow-down and pin-point the search for the specific source of a vibration concern and to arrive at an accurate repair.</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Gather specific information on the customer's vibration concern.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Perform the road testing steps in sequence as identified in Vibration Analysis - Road Testing in order to duplicate the customer's concern and evaluate the symptoms of the concern under changing conditions. Observe what the vibration feels like and what it sounds like. Observe when the symptoms first appear, when they change, and when they cease.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Determine if the customer's vibration concern is truly an abnormal condition or something that is potentially an operating characteristic of the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Systematically eliminate or "rule-out" possible vehicle systems.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Focus diagnostic efforts on the remaining vehicle system and systematically eliminate or "rule-out" possible components of that system.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make a repair on the remaining component, or components, which have not been eliminated systematically, and must therefore be the cause of the vibration.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the customer's concern has been eliminated or at least brought to an acceptable level.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Again perform the road testing steps in sequence as identified in Vibration Analysis - Road Testing in order to verify that the vehicle did not have more than one vibration occurring.<br><br><br><br><b>Preliminary Visual/Physical Inspection</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect for aftermarket equipment and modifications which could affect the operation of the vehicle rotating component systems.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the easily accessible or visible components of the vehicle rotating component systems for obvious damage or conditions which could cause the symptom.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the tire inflation pressures for the proper pressure.<br><br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br>Improper component routing or isolation, or components which are worn or faulty may be the cause of intermittent conditions that are difficult to duplicate.
