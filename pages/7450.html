The engine control module (ECM) supplies 5 volts to the ECT sensor signal circuit and supplies a ground to the low reference circuit. <br><br><br>The ECM uses this high side coolant rationality diagnostic to determine if the input from the ECT sensor is skewed warmer than normal. The internal clock of the ECM will record the amount of time the ignition is OFF. If the calibrated ignition OFF time is met at start-up, the ECM will compare the temperature difference between the ECT and the intake air temperature (IAT) to determine if the temperatures are within an acceptable operating range of each other.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0112, P0113, P0117, P0118, P0128, P0502, P0503, P0601, P2610 are not set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle has had a minimum ignition OFF time of 8 hours.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The start-up IAT is warmer than 10&deg;C (50&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Fuel Level Sensor parameter is more than 2.5 percent.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This DTC runs once per ignition cycle within the enabling conditions.<br><br><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects a temperature difference at power-up that indicates that the ECT sensor is 30&deg;C (54&deg;F) warmer than the IAT sensor. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>OR<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects a temperature difference at power-up that indicates that the ECT sensor is 16&deg;C (29&deg;F) more than the IAT sensor, and the time spent cranking the engine is more than 30 seconds, when the fuel level is greater than 2.5 percent. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>OR<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects a temperature difference at power-up that indicates that the ECT sensor is 16&deg;C (29&deg;F) more than the IAT sensor. Then the vehicle must be driven for more than 6 minutes and 40 seconds at greater than 40 km/h (25 mph). If the IAT sensor then decreases more than 5&deg;C (9&deg;F), an engine block heater was detected and the test is aborted. If the IAT sensor does not decrease, an engine block heater was not detected and DTC P0116 will set.<br><br><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br>DTC P0116 is a Type B DTC.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Clearing the MIL/DTC</b><br><br>DTC P0116 is a Type B DTC.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the ECT sensor terminals for corrosion and for engine coolant leaking through the sensor. Engine coolant that is leaking through the sensor will create a high resistance short to ground. This condition results in less voltage on the ECT sensor signal circuit, which is interpreted by the ECM as a warmer ECT.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An IAT sensor that is skewed colder at various ambient temperatures due to greater resistance than is normal will increase the range between these two sensors. Measure and record the resistance of the IAT sensor at various ambient temperatures, then compare those measurements to the Temperature vs Resistance table. Refer to Temperature Versus Resistance  (<a href="6967.html">Temperature Versus Resistance</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A slight to moderate resistance in the IAT sensor signal circuit or low reference circuit will increase the range between these two sensors.
