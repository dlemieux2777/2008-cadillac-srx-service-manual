<h1>Content Theft Deterrent (CTD) Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Content Theft Deterrent (CTD) Description and Operation</b><br><br>When armed, the content theft deterrent (CTD) system is designed to deter vehicle content theft by pulsing the horns and exterior lamps for approximately 30 seconds when an unauthorized vehicle entry is detected. However, the CTD system does not affect engine starting. <br><br><br>An unauthorized entry can be any of the following with the CTD system armed: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When any door or the liftgate is opened without first being unlocked using the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the driver door is opened without being first unlocked using the driver door key cylinder<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the hood is opened. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After a battery reconnect, if the battery was disconnected with the CTD system armed.<br><br><br>The components of the CTD system are: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Body control module (BCM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rear (auxiliary) body control module (RBCM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="4291.html">Remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Security indicator <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driver door module (DDM)/passenger door module (PDM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Door ajar switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Liftgate ajar switch <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driver door key cylinder switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The hood ajar switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inclination sensor (RPO UA2) <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Intrusion sensor (RPO UA2)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Theft deterrent alarm siren (RPO UA2)<br><br><br><br><b>Arming the CTD System</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>The system is not armed if the doors are locked manually. The <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> must be used to arm the CTD system.</b><br><br><br><br>Use the following procedure in order to arm the system:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the shift lever in PARK.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn OFF the ignition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Exit the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lock the doors with the LOCK button on the transmitter. The system is in standby mode and will not start the arming timer until all doors are closed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system will begin the arm sequence immediately after the last door is closed. If the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> is used to arm the system after the vehicle doors are closed, the arm sequence will begin as soon as the LOCK command is received by the transmitter.<br><br><br><br><b>Locking The Vehicle Without Arming The CTD System</b><br><br>Locking the vehicle may be accomplished without arming the CTD system. Use of the manual door locks or using the key to lock the doors will lock the vehicle, but will not arm the CTD system.<br><br><br><b>Disarming an Armed System/Silencing an Alarm</b><br><br>If system arming has occurred, it must be disarmed.<br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Using the power door unlock switch or manually unlocking the doors does not disable the CTD arm mode. Also, disconnecting the battery or pulling fuses does not disable the arm mode, since the BCM stores the CTD mode status in memory.</b><br><br><br><br>To disarm the CTD system, perform one of the following:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the UNLOCK button on the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Unlock the driver door using the door key cylinder.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Insert a valid key into the ignition and start the vehicle.<br><br><br><br><b>CTD System Armed/Event Indication</b><br><br>There is no indication that the CTD alarm is activated while the system is armed. The CTD system will confirm arming with several indicators:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> lock button is pressed once, the exterior lamps will flash and the security indicator will illuminate for approximately 30 seconds, then turn off.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> lock button is pressed 2 times within 3 seconds, the exterior lamps will flash, the horn will chirp once, and the security indicator will not illuminate.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> liftgate button is pressed and held, the alarm will temporarily disarm, the liftgate will open/release, the security indicator will flash for approximately 60 seconds, then turn off. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the BCM determines that a switch indicates an open door, liftgate, or hood when attempting to arm the CTD system, the exterior lights will flash once and the security indicator will flash for approximately 60 seconds, then turn off. If any of the noted closures remains open after arming, the CTD system will ignore that ajar switch until the door is closed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When disarming the system after an alarm event, the horn will chirp 3 times indicating that the alarm event had occurred.<br><br><br><br><b>CTD Component Description</b><br><br>The following is a description of each component used in the content theft deterrent (CTD) system:<br><br><br><b>Body Control Module (BCM) </b><br><br>The CTD system is an internal function of the BCM which utilizes serial data and various switch inputs to perform CTD functions. When the BCM detects an unauthorized entry, it activates the horns and exterior lamps for 30 seconds. The system will re-arm immediately following an alarm event.<br><br><br><b><a href="4291.html">Remote Control</a> Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR)</b><br><br>The RCDLR receives input from the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a>, transferring information to the BCM via serial data. The BCM uses this information along with other information for activation and deactivation of the CTD system.<br><br><br><b>Security Indicator </b><br><br>The security indicator is illuminated by the instrument panel cluster (IPC) based on information, via serial data, from the BCM for CTD or from the theft deterrent module (TDM) for immobilizer. The CTD system uses the security indicator to inform the driver of system status prior to arming.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The CTD system controls the security indicator only when the ignition is OFF. The CTD system uses the indicator to identify system status.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The immobilizer system commands the IPC to control the security indicator only when the ignition switch is ON as a malfunction indicator. Refer to Immobilizer Description and Operation  (<a href="4017.html">Immobilizer Description and Operation</a>) for more information on the immobilizer system.<br><br><br><br><b>Driver Door Module (DDM)/Passenger Door Module (PDM)</b><br><br>The DDM and PDM receive discrete inputs from the front door ajar switches. The DDM and PDM send a serial data message to the BCM indicating the status of the front door ajar switches. The DDM also monitors the door cylinder switch. When the door key is used the DDM sends a serial data message to the BCM indicating that a valid key has been used to unlock the driver door cylinder and the BCM will disarm CTD system.<br><br><br><b>Door Ajar Switches</b><br><br>The CTD system uses the door ajar switches as a status indicator to activate the alarm. The BCM receives the status of the front door ajar switches based on a discrete input from each front door ajar switch or serial data messages from the DDM/PDM. The rear door ajar switches are monitored by the BCM via a discrete input from each door ajar switch. If the BCM receives a serial data message or discrete signal indicating a door is opened when the CTD system is armed, the BCM activates the alarm.<br><br><br><b>Liftgate Ajar Switch</b><br><br>The CTD system uses the liftgate ajar switch as a status indicator to activate the alarm. The liftgate ajar switch is monitored by the BCM via serial data or a discrete input from the switch. When the CTD system is armed and the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> is used to open the liftgate, the alarm will not activate. Instead, the alarm will go into an extended delay mode, and the security indicator will flash. After approximately 60 seconds, the CTD system will reactivate and ignore the open liftgate signal until closed. If the BCM receives a status signal from the liftgate ajar switch indicating it was opened without the keyless entry transmitter, the BCM activates the alarm.<br><br><br><b>Driver Door Cylinder Switch</b><br><br>The CTD system uses the driver door cylinder switch as a means to disarm the CTD system. When the driver door key cylinder is rotated the CTD system will immediately disarm.<br><br><br><b>Hood Ajar Switch</b><br><br>The CTD system uses the hood ajar switch as a status indicator to activate the alarm. The BCM monitors the hood ajar switch via a discrete input from the switch. If the BCM receives a signal indicating the hood has been opened when the CTD system is armed, the BCM activates the alarm.<br><br><br><b>Inclination Sensor (RPO UA2) </b><br><br>The inclination sensor is monitored by the RBCM. The inclination sensor monitors the parked of the vehicle. Instances where vehicle angle may change is during jacking up of the vehicle or towing of the vehicle. If the CTD is in the armed mode and vehicle inclination is detected, CTD will enter the alarm mode.<br><br><br><b>Intrusion Sensor (RPO UA2)</b><br><br>The intrusion sensor is monitored by the BCM. The intrusion sensor is a motion sensor which monitors movement within the vehicle. If the CTD is in the armed mode and vehicle intrusion is detected, CTD will enter the alarm mode.<br><br><br><b>Theft Deterrent Alarm Siren (RPO UA2)</b><br><br>The theft deterrent alarm is a theft deterrent sounder. If the CTD System is in the alarm mode, the RBCM request the theft deterrent alarm ON.<br><br><br><b>Inputs</b><br><br>The BCM monitors the following inputs for CTD:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Door ajar switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driver door cylinder switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="4648.html">Keyless entry transmitter</a> LOCK/UNLOCK buttons; a serial data message from the RCDLR<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Immobilizer status-The BCM uses the immobilizer status for disarming the system or silencing an alarm when the correct vehicle key is used to start the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Liftgate ajar switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Hood ajar switch<br><br><br><br><b>Outputs</b><br><br>The BCM controls the following for CTD:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The horn relay<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The exterior lamps<br><br><br><br><b>Inputs</b><br><br>The RBCM (RPO UA2) monitors the following inputs for CTD:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>BCM<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inclination sensor<br><br><br><br><b>Outputs</b><br><br>The BCM controls the following for CTD:<br><br>Theft deterrent alarm siren<br><br></div>
