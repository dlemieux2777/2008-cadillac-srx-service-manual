In low speed, the fans are configured in series. In high speed, the fans are configured in parallel.<br><br><br>In low speed operation, the ECM applies ground to the coil side of the low speed relay, which is relay 1. Voltage is applied directly to the left cooling fan through the switch side of the low speed relay. The right fan is connected in series to the left fan through the de-energized series/parallel relay so that both fans operate at low speed.<br><br><br>In high speed operation, the ECM applies a ground to the coil side of the low speed relay, which is relay 1, the series/parallel relay, and the high speed relay, which is relay 2. Voltage is applied directly to the right cooling fan through the switch side of the high speed relay. The left cooling fan obtains voltage through the low speed relay and ground through the series/parallel relay.<br><br><br>When the ECM is commanding a fan relay ON, the voltage of the control circuit should be low, near 0 volts. When the ECM is commanding a fan relay OFF, the voltage of the control circuit should be high, near battery voltage.<br><br><br>A vehicle equipped with the trailer package option will get 2 puller and 2 pusher electric fans. During low speed operation, all 4 electric fans will operate at low speed. During high speed operation, all 4 electric fans will operate at high speed.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system voltage is between 9-18 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The relay control circuit is transitioned from OFF to ON or ON to OFF.<br><br><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><b>P0480</b><br><br>The ECM detects an open circuit in the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit.<br><br><br><b>P0481</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects an open circuit in the high speed cooling fan relay control circuit.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The above condition is present for 30 seconds.<br><br><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br>DTCs P0480 and P0481 are Type B DTCs.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Clearing the DTC</b><br><br>DTCs P0480 and P0481 are Type B DTCs.<br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine Cooling Schematics  (<a href="839.html">Electrical Diagrams</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electrical Center Identification Views  (<a href="2925.html#Application%20and%20ID/">Application and ID</a>)<br><br><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br>Component Connector End Views  (<a href="0.html#Diagrams/Connector%20Views/">Connector Views</a>)<br><b>Description and Operation</b><br><br>Cooling Fan Description and Operation  (<a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/Description%20and%20Operation/">Description and Operation</a>)<br><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Probing Electrical Connectors  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electrical Center Identification Views  (<a href="2925.html#Application%20and%20ID/">Application and ID</a>)<br><br><b>DTC Type Reference</b><br><br>Powertrain Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Type Definitions  (<a href="2.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Diagnostic%20Trouble%20Code%20Descriptions/">Diagnostic Trouble Code Descriptions</a>)<br><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br>Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>)for scan tool information<br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br>Ignition ON, command each relay ON and OFF with a scan tool.
