For this vehicle that is equipped with the engine off natural vacuum (EONV) diagnostic, the Service Bay Test uses the scan tool to initiate the control module's regular sequence of EVAP system DTC tests, but with different enable criteria. By using the Service Bay Test the I/M indicator can be set without the need for multiple cold soaks.<br><br><br>The scan tool displays for the Service Bay Test are based on the events that occur within the following three categories:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine running portion of the tests-The vehicle must remain at rest, in Park, or in Neutral, during this portion of the test. This test inspects for large leaks, a leaking purge valve and/or vent system restrictions. The scan tool will display test progress or the reason for an abort or failure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive cycle-The scan tool will display time and distance needed to warm the fuel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition OFF-During this portion of the test, the engine controller will remain active for up to 45 minutes when the ignition is turned OFF to allow control of the EVAP vent valve and run the EONV test. The engine controller inspects for small leaks during this period by monitoring <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> pressure or vacuum. If the system is sealed, there will be a pressure or vacuum change. Pressure or vacuum changes that are less than the calibrated values indicate a leak.<br><br><br>When the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/Evaporative%20Emissions%20System/Evaporative%20Emission%20Control%20Canister/">EVAP</a> diagnostics are initiated by the Service Bay Test, the scan tool will indicate if the enable conditions listed below are not met, or will display a specific reason if the test aborts. When complete, the display will indicate that the tests passed or failed.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the Test</b><br><br>The following conditions must be met in order to enable the Service Bay Test:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The battery voltage is between 11-18 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine coolant temperature (ECT) is less than 70&deg;C (158&deg;F) at start-up.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/Evaporative%20Emissions%20System/Evaporative%20Emission%20Control%20Canister/">EVAP</a> I/M system status indicator is set to NO.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel level is 15-85 percent capacity and cannot be refueled during the tests.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are no DTCs displayed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle must be driven for the time and distance specified on the scan tool.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ambient air temperature is between 0-40&deg;C (32-104&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition must remain OFF during the engine OFF portion of the test, and the vehicle must remain at rest.<br><br><br><br><b>Test Procedure</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>If the Service Bay Test aborts or fails a DTC will NOT be set.</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install a scan tool.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select the Service Bay Test with the scan tool.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Caution:</b>  Refer to Road Test Caution  (<a href="5823.html">Road Test Warning</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Follow the instructions on the scan tool.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>&bull;<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test aborts, correct the condition for running the test and then retest.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>&bull;<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test fails, repair the vehicle for the condition indicated by the failure message on the scan tool.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/Evaporative%20Emissions%20System/Evaporative%20Emission%20Control%20Canister/">EVAP</a> I/M system status is set to YES.<br><br><br></div>
