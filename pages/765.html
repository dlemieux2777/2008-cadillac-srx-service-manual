In low speed, the fans are configured in series. In high speed, the fans are configured in parallel.<br><br><br>In low speed operation, the ECM applies ground to the coil side of the low speed relay, which is R1 cool/fan 1 relay. Voltage is applied directly to the left cooling fan through the switch side of the low speed relay. The right fan is connected in series to the left fan through the de-energized series/parallel relay, which is R7 cool/fan 2 relay, so that both fans operate at low speed.<br><br><br>In high speed operation, the ECM applies a ground to the coil side of the low speed relay, the series/parallel relay, and the high speed relay, which is relay R2 cool/fan relay. Voltage is applied directly to the right cooling fan through the switch side of the high speed relay. The left cooling fan obtains voltage through the low speed relay and ground through the series/parallel relay.<br><br><br>When the ECM is commanding a fan relay ON, the voltage of the control circuit should be low, near 0 volts. When the ECM is commanding a fan relay OFF, the voltage of the control circuit should be high, near battery voltage. If the ECM detects that the actual voltage of the relay control circuit is different than the expected voltage, DTC P0480 or P0481 will set and the affected ECM driver will be disabled.<br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine Cooling Schematics  (<a href="839.html">Electrical Diagrams</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electrical Center Identification Views  (<a href="2925.html#Application%20and%20ID/">Application and ID</a>)<br><br><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br>Component Connector End Views  (<a href="0.html#Diagrams/Connector%20Views/">Connector Views</a>)<br><b>Description and Operation</b><br><br>Cooling Fan Description and Operation  (<a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/Description%20and%20Operation/">Description and Operation</a>)<br><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><br><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br>Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>)for scan tool information<br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If DTCs P0480 or P0481 are set, then perform those diagnostics first.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, command each relay ON and OFF with a scan tool.
