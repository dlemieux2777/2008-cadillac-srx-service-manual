<h1>Heated Oxygen and Oxygen Sensor Notice</h1><br><br><b>Heated Oxygen and <a href="121.html">Oxygen Sensor</a> Notice</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Do not remove the pigtail from either the heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) or the <a href="121.html">oxygen sensor</a> (O2S). Removing the pigtail or the connector will affect sensor operation. <br><br>Handle the <a href="121.html">oxygen sensor</a> carefully. Do not drop the HO2S. Keep the in-line electrical connector and the louvered end free of grease, dirt, or other contaminants. Do not use cleaning solvents of any type. <br><br>Do not repair the wiring, connector or terminals. Replace the <a href="121.html">oxygen sensor</a> if the pigtail wiring, connector, or terminal is damaged. <br><br>This external clean air reference is obtained by way of the <a href="121.html">oxygen sensor</a> signal and heater wires. Any attempt to repair the wires, connectors, or terminals could result in the obstruction of the air reference and degraded sensor performance. <br><br>The following guidelines should be used when servicing the heated oxygen sensor:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not apply contact cleaner or other materials to the sensor or vehicle harness connectors. These materials may get into the sensor causing poor performance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not damage the sensor pigtail and harness wires in such a way that the wires inside are exposed. This could provide a path for foreign materials to enter the sensor and cause performance problems.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure the sensor or vehicle lead wires are not bent sharply or kinked. Sharp bends or kinks could block the reference air path through the lead wire.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not remove or defeat the <a href="121.html">oxygen sensor</a> ground wire, where applicable. Vehicles that utilize the ground wired sensor may rely on this ground as the only ground contact to the sensor. Removal of the ground wire will cause poor engine performance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the peripheral seal remains intact on the vehicle harness connector in order to prevent damage due to water intrusion. The engine harness may be repaired using Packard's Crimp and Splice Seals Terminal Repair Kit. Under no circumstances should repairs be soldered since this could result in the air reference being obstructed.<br><br><br><br></div>
