<h1>Electronic Suspension Control Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">Suspension</a> Control Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">Suspension</a> Control Description</b><br><br>The electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> control system, also known as the magneto-rheological real time damping (MRRTD) system independently controls the fluid viscosity in each of the 4 shock absorbers in order to control the vehicle ride characteristics. The electronic suspension control (ESC) system is capable of making these changes within milliseconds. The ESC system consists of the following major components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> (ESC) module<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The front/rear position sensors<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The front/rear adjustable shock absorbers<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The shock absorber electrical actuators, which are integrated within the shock absorbers<br><br><br>The ESC controls the damping mode selection according to the following factors:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The chassis pitch input<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> position<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The body to wheel displacement<br><br><br>The ESC module evaluates these inputs in order to separately control the shock absorbers, providing an enhanced ride and comfort level over the widest possible range of operating conditions.<br><br><br><b>Electronic Suspension Control Module</b><br><br>The electronic suspension control (ESC) module provides electronic control logic and output drive for each shock absorber. The ESC module makes decisions due to road and driving conditions based on various inputs. The ESC module receives input information by sensors that are directly connected to the ESC module or by other systems through the serial data line and uses these inputs to independently control the shock absorbers at each corner.<br><br><br><b>Electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">Suspension</a> Control Position Sensors</b><br><br>The electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> control (ESC) position sensors provide the ESC module with the body to wheel displacement input. The ESC module uses this and other inputs in order to control the stiffness of the shock absorber. If any body or wheel motion is detected, the ESC module will determine how soft or firm each shock absorber should be to provide the best ride. The ESC position sensors are mounted at each corner of the vehicle between the <a href="3464.html">control arm</a> and the body/frame.<br><br><br><b>Electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">Suspension</a> Control Shock Absorber or Strut</b><br><br>The electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> control (ESC) shock absorbers are monotube type which provide damping by increasing magnetic flux to magnetic particles to resist suspension movement. The ESC shock absorber has the capability of providing multiple modes or values of damping forces, in both compression and rebound direction. The damping forces are achieved by increasing or decreasing the magnetic flux to shock absorbers. <br><br><br>The front ESC actuator connector is located at the top of the shock absorber. The rear ESC actuator connector is at the top of the shock absorber. The rear shock absorbers have jumper harnesses for ease of maintenance.<br><br><br><b>Electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">Suspension</a> Control Operation</b><br><br>The electronic <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> control (ESC) system uses the information from other systems in order to execute certain functions.<br><br><br>The ESC system does not have a malfunction indicator lamp, but instead uses the instrument panel cluster (IPC) for the display functions. When the ESC system detects a malfunction that sets a DTC, the ESC system sends a message on the serial data line directly or through the powertrain control module (PCM) to the IPC, which will display one of the following messages:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>SHOCKS INOPERATIVE<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>SERVICE <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">SUSPENSION</a> SYSTEM<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>SPEED LIMITED <br><br><br>The SHOCKS INOPERATIVE message will only be displayed if the ESC system detects a malfunction that sets a DTC and causes the ESC system to disable all 4 shock absorbers. The ESC system will send a message on the serial data line to the IPC to display this message.<br><br><br>The SERVICE <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">SUSPENSION</a> SYSTEM message will only be displayed if the ESC system detects any malfunction that sets a DTC. The ESC system will send a message on the serial data line to the IPC to display this message.<br><br><br>The SPEED LIMITED message will only be displayed if the ESC system detects a malfunction that sets a DTC and causes the ESC system to disable all 4 shock absorbers. The ESC system will send a message on the serial data line to the PCM indicating that all 4 shock absorbers were disabled. The PCM then sends a message to the IPC to display this message.<br><br><br>The ESC module has the ability to store DTCs as current or history codes. Most ESC system malfunctions will display a message in the IPC and set a DTC. The message will remain ON until the RESET button is pressed on the driver information center (DIC). As long as the DTC is current, the message will be displayed after every ignition cycle and the RESET button must be pressed to bypass the message.<br><br><br>The ESC system uses an ignition cycling diagnostic approach in order to reduce the occurrence of false or intermittent DTCs that do not affect the functionality of the ESC system. This allows for the fail-soft actions to be taken whenever a malfunction condition is current, but requires the malfunction to be current for a certain number of ignition cycles before the corresponding malfunction code and message will be stored or displayed.<br><br><br>If the ESC detects a malfunction, the ESC system defaults with a fail-soft action. A fail-soft action refers to any specific action the ESC system takes in order to compensate for a detected malfunction. A typical ESC fail-soft action would be if the ESC system detects a malfunction with a shock absorber. <br><br></div>
