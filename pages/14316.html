The technician may find that when replacing the inlet or outlet transmission cooler lines, the new lines cannot be connected to the transmission.<br><br>A change to the transmission cooler line fittings was implemented in production on February 1, 2004. The cooler line fittings were changed to a design with a longer lead in pilot (1). The cooler line fittings with the longer lead in pilot will not fit on models built before February 1, 2004.<br><br>The longer lead in pilot fittings (1) (9/16-18 UNF) have replaced the shorter lead in pilot fittings (2) (3/8-18 NPSF w/check ball & 1/4-18 NPSF).<br><br>If the transmission cooler lines will not connect, then replace them with the following cooler line fittings as appropriate with the older, shorter lead in pilot design:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>For vehicles built prior to February 1, 2004, use Transmission Fluid Cooler Inlet Hose, P/N 20793004.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>For vehicles built after February 1, 2004, use Transmission Fluid Cooler Inlet Hose, second design P/N 15264588.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>For vehicles built prior to February 1, 2004, use Transmission Fluid Cooler Outlet Hose, P/N 20793005.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>For vehicles built after February 1, 2004, use Transmission Fluid Cooler Outlet Hose, second design P/N 15264589.<br><br>The torque specification has changed for the fittings to case.

The old fittings are different sizes (3/8-18 NPSF & 1/4-18 NPSF) and would contain the cooler check ball. The new fittings are the same size as each other (9/16-18 UNF) and do not have a cooler check ball.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/327191800.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Parts Information<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
