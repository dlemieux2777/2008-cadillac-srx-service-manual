<h1>Fuel</h1><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>GASOLINE OCTANE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Use premium unleaded gasoline with a posted octane rating of 91 or higher. You may also use regular unleaded gasoline rated at 87 octane or higher, but your vehicle's acceleration may be slightly reduced, and you may notice a slight audible knocking noise, commonly referred to as spark knock. If the octane is less than 87, you may notice a heavy knocking noise when you drive. If this occurs, use a gasoline rated at 87 octane or higher as soon as possible. Otherwise, you might damage your engine. If you are using gasoline rated at 87 octane or higher and you hear heavy knocking, your engine needs service.<br><br><b>GASOLINE SPECIFICATIONS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>It is recommended that gasoline meet specifications which were developed by automobile manufacturers around the world and contained in the World-Wide Fuel Charter which is available from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers at www.autoalliance.org/fuel_charter.htm. Gasoline meeting these specifications could provide improved driveability and emission control system performance compared to other gasoline. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In Canada, look for the "Auto Makers' Choice" label on the pump.<br><br><b>CALIFORNIA FUEL</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If your vehicle is certified to meet California Emission Standards (see the underhood emission control label), it is designed to operate on fuels that meet California specifications. If this fuel is not available in states adopting California emissions standards, your vehicle will operate satisfactorily on fuels meeting federal specifications, but emission control system performance may be affected. The <a href="989.html">malfunction indicator lamp</a> may turn on (see Malfunction Indicator Lamp ) and your vehicle may fail a smog-check test. If it is determined that the condition is caused by the type of fuel used, repairs may not be covered by your warranty.<br><br><b>ADDITIVES</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To provide cleaner air, all gasoline in the United States are now required to contain additives that will help prevent engine and fuel system deposits from forming, allowing your emission control system to work properly. You should not have to add anything to your fuel. However, some gasoline contain only the minimum amount of additive required to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations. General Motors recommends that you buy gasoline that are advertised to help keep fuel injectors and intake valves clean. If your vehicle experiences problems due to dirty injectors or valves, try a different brand of gasoline.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Gasoline containing oxygenates, such as ethers and ethanol, and reformulated gasoline may be available in your area to contribute to clean air. General Motors recommends that you use these gasoline, particularly if they comply with the specifications described earlier.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTICE:</b>  Your vehicle was not designed for fuel that contains methanol. Do not use fuel containing methanol. It can corrode metal parts in your fuel system and also damage the plastic and rubber parts. That damage would not be covered under your warranty.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Some gasoline that are not reformulated for low emissions may contain an octane-enhancing additive called methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); ask the attendant where you buy gasoline whether the fuel contains MMT. General Motors does not recommend the use of such gasoline Fuels containing MMT can reduce the life of <a href="969.html">spark plugs</a> and the performance of the emission control system may be affected. The <a href="989.html">malfunction indicator lamp</a> may turn on.<br><br><b>FUELS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If you plan on driving in another country outside the United States or Canada, the proper fuel may be hard to find. Never use leaded gasoline or any other fuel not recommended in the previous text on fuel. Costly repairs caused by use of improper fuel would not be covered by your warranty.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To check the fuel availability, ask an auto club, or contact a major oil company that does business in the country where you will be driving.<br><br><br></div>
