<h1>Brake System Vehicle Road Test</h1><br><br><b>Brake System Vehicle Road Test</b><br><br><b>Preliminary Inspections</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Visually inspect easily accessible brake system components for obvious damage and/or leaks which may indicate that the vehicle should not be driven until further inspections have been completed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the <a href="2497.html">brake master cylinder</a> reservoir fluid level and adjust only if necessary for brake system road testing. Refer to Master Cylinder Reservoir Filling  (<a href="7908.html">Master Cylinder Reservoir Filling</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the tire inflation pressures and adjust as necessary.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the tire tread patterns to ensure that they are the same or very similar, especially per axle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the vehicle is not loaded unevenly prior to brake system road testing.<br><br><br><br><b>Road Testing Procedure</b><br><br><b>Caution:</b>  Road test a vehicle under safe conditions and while obeying all traffic laws. Do not attempt any maneuvers that could jeopardize vehicle control. Failure to adhere to these precautions could lead to serious personal injury and vehicle damage.<br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start the engine and allow it to idle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check to see if the brake system warning lamp remains illuminated.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the brake system warning lamp remains illuminated, DO NOT proceed to test drive the vehicle until it is diagnosed and repaired. Refer to Symptoms - Hydraulic Brakes  (<a href="2502.html">Symptoms - Hydraulic Brakes</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select a smooth, dry, clean and level road or large lot that is as free of traffic and obstacles as possible for brake system low speed road testing.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the transmission in PARK, lightly apply the brake pedal. Observe both the pedal feel and the pedal travel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the brake pedal apply felt spongy, or the pedal travel was excessive, DO NOT drive the vehicle until it is repaired.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the brake pedal apply did not feel spongy and the pedal travel was not excessive, proceed to step 8.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Release and apply the brakes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>While continuing to apply the brakes, shift the transmission into DRIVE, release the brakes and allow the engine to idle the vehicle away from the stopped position.

Have the assistant observe for brake system noise from the side of the vehicle closest to them, while you observe both the pedal effort and the pedal travel.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the brake pedal apply effort was excessive, or the pedal travel was excessive, DO NOT continue to test drive the vehicle until it is repaired.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>12.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the brake pedal apply effort was not excessive and the pedal travel was not excessive, proceed to step 13.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in the opposite direction, at the same low speed and lightly apply the brakes while driving past the assistant. Have the assistant observe for brake system noise from the side of the vehicle closest to him.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>14.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle at a low speed and shift the transmission into NEUTRAL without applying the brakes. Observe for a rapid deceleration in vehicle speed, indicating possible brake drag.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>15.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select a smooth, dry, clean and level road that is as free of heavy traffic as possible for brake system moderate speed road testing.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle at a moderate speed.
