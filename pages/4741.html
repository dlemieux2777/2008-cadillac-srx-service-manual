<h1>Automatic Day-Night Mirror Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Automatic Day-Night Mirror Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Inside Rearview Mirror with Automatic Day-Night System Operation</b><br><br>The inside rearview mirror consist of 2 photocell sensors. The headlight sensor, located on the front of the mirror is used to determine light conditions present at the mirror face from sources behind the vehicle. The ambient light sensor, located on the rear of the mirror is used to determine exterior light conditions present at the mirror. At night, with the automatic day-night feature enabled, the inside rearview mirror will automatically darken to reduce glare from headlamps behind the vehicle.<br><br><br>In daytime conditions, the mirror operates at a normal, clear state due to the high exterior light conditions that are indicated by the ambient light sensor. When the vehicles gear selector is placed in the REVERSE position, backup lamp voltage is supplied as an input to the inside rearview mirror. In night time conditions only, the inside rearview mirror monitors the backup lamp voltage to disable the automatic day-night feature. This allows the inside rearview mirror face to gradually change to a normal, clear state and allow the driver to see objects in the mirror clearly when backing up.<br><br><br><b>Driver Outside Rearview Mirror with Automatic Day-Night System Operation</b><br><br>The automatic day-night feature of the driver outside rearview mirror is controlled by the inside rearview mirror. The inside rearview mirror supplies a signal and low reference to the driver outside rearview mirror. At night, with the automatic day-night feature enabled, the driver outside rearview mirror will automatically darken with the inside rearview mirror to reduce glare from headlamps behind the vehicle. Refer to Outside Mirror Description and Operation  (<a href="4742.html">Outside Mirror Description and Operation</a>) for further description and operation of the driver outside rearview mirror.<br><br><br><b>Inside Rearview Mirror with Automatic Day-Night Switch Operation</b><br><br>The ON/OFF switch is used to enable/disable the automatic day-night feature of the inside rearview mirror. To enable the automatic day-night feature, turn the ignition ON and depress the ON/OFF switch.
