<h1>A/T Control - DTC P0756 Diagnostic Tips</h1>INFORMATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 01-07-30-036H<br><br>Date: January 29, 2009<br><br>Subject: <br>Diagnostic Tips for Automatic Transmission DTC P0756, Second, Third, Fourth Gear Start<br><br>Models:<br>2009 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks<br>2009 and Prior HUMMER H2, H3<br>2009 and Prior Saab 9-7X<br><br>with 4L60-E, 4L65-E or 4L70E Automatic Transmission (RPOs M30, M32 or M70)<br><br>Supercede:<br><br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2009 model year and add details regarding spacer plates. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 01-07-30-036G (Section 07 - Transmission/Transaxle).<br><br>Some dealership technicians may have difficulty diagnosing DTC P0756, 2-3 Shift Valve Performance on 4L60-E, 4L65-E or 4L70E automatic transmissions. As detailed in the Service Manual, when the PCM detects a 4-3-3-4 shift pattern, DTC P0756 will set. Some customers may also describe a condition of a second, third or fourth gear start that may have the same causes but has not set this DTC yet. Below are some tips when diagnosing this DTC:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>This is a performance code. This means that a mechanical malfunction exists.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>This code is not set by electrical issues such as a damaged wiring harness or poor electrical connections. Electrical problems would cause a DTC P0758, P0787 or P0788 to set.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The most likely cause is chips/debris plugging the filtered AFL oil at orifice # 29 on the top of the spacer plate (48). This is a very small hole and is easily plugged by a small amount of debris. It is important to remove the spacer plate and inspect orifice # 29 and the immediate area for the presence of chips/debris. Also, the transmission case passage directly above this orifice and the valve body passage directly below should be inspected and cleaned of any chips/debris. For 2003 and newer vehicles the spacer plate should be replaced. The service replacement spacer plate is a bonded style with gaskets and solenoid filter screens bonded to the spacer plate. These screens can help to prevent plugging of orifice # 29 caused by small debris or chips.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>This code could be set if the 2-3 shift valve (368) were stuck or hung-up in its bore. Inspect the 2-3 shift valve (368) and the 2-3 shuttle valve (369) for free movement or damage and clean the valves, the bore and the valve body passages.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>This code could be set by a 2-3 shift solenoid (367b) if it were cracked, broken or leaking. Refer to Shift Solenoid Leak Test in the appropriate Service Manual for the leak test procedure. Based on parts return findings, a damaged or leaking shift solenoid is the least likely cause of this condition. Simply replacing a shift solenoid will not correct this condition unless the solenoid has been found to be cracked, broken or leaking.<br><br>It is important to also refer to the appropriate Service Manual or Service Information (SI) for further possible causes of this condition.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br><br></div>
