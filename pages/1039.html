This is accomplished by viewing the I/M System Status display on a scan tool. Using a scan tool, the technician can observe the I/M System Status in order to verify that the vehicle meets the criteria that comply with the local area requirements.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Updating the I/M System Status</b><br><br>Each system monitor requires at least one, and sometimes several diagnostic tests. The result of each test is reported by a diagnostic trouble code (DTC). A system monitor is complete when either all of the DTCs composing the monitor have Run and Passed, or when any one of the DTCs comprising the monitor has illuminated the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL). Once the system monitor is complete, the I/M System Status display will indicate YES in the Completed column.<br><br><br>For example, when the HO2S Heater Status indicates YES, either all of the oxygen sensor heater tests have passed or one of the tests has illuminated the <a href="989.html">MIL</a>. If the vehicle has four heated oxygen sensors, either all four heater circuit tests have passed or one of the heater circuit tests has illuminated the MIL. The I/M System Status will indicate NO under the Completed column when any of the required tests for that system have not run. The following is a list of conditions that would set the I/M System Status indicator to NO:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is new from the factory and has not yet been driven through the necessary drive conditions to complete the tests.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The battery has been disconnected or discharged below operating voltage.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The control module power or ground has been interrupted.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The control module has been reprogrammed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The control module DTCs have been cleared.<br><br><br><br><b>Monitored <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/">Emission Control Systems</a></b><br><br>The OBD II System monitors all <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/">emission control systems</a> that are on-board.
