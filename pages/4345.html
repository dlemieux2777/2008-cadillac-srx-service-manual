It is powered by a fused, battery positive, voltage circuit connected through the vehicle wiring to the 3-button assembly and the radio, and attached by means of coax cables to the cellular and navigation antennas. Ground for the module is accomplished by means of dedicated circuits that are routed with body wiring systems to chassis ground points. The module houses 2 modems, one to process <a href="4190.html">global positioning system</a> (GPS) data, and the other for cellular information. Satellites orbiting earth are constantly transmitting signals of their current location, from which the OnStar(R) system is able to pinpoint its own location. The navigation antenna receives these GPS signals and provides the data to the VCIM to be processed. The VCIM communicates with the rest of the vehicle over the serial data bus. The ignition state is determined by the VCIM through serial data messaging. The module also has the capability of commanding the horn, initiating door lock/unlock and operating the exterior lamps using the serial data circuits. When an OnStar(R) keypress is made, a serial data message is sent to the audio system to mute all radio functions and transmit OnStar(R) originated audio. After the audio system is muted, the OnStar(R) signals are transmitted to the audio system on the cellular telephone voice signal circuit, and returned to the module on the cellular telephone voice low reference circuit. The cellular modem connects the OnStar(R) system to the cellular carriers communication system by interacting with the national cellular infrastructure. The module sends and receives all cellular communications over the cellular antenna and cellular antenna coax.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The customer concern may have been due to a lack of cellular service in a given area or a failure in the National Cellular Network infrastructure that has since been corrected.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the prompt OnStar Request Ended is heard without pressing the white dot button at the end of an OnStar(R) keypress, the OnStar(R) system at one time made a successful cellular connection, but was unable to complete the call.
