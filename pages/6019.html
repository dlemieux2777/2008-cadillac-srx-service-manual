<h1>Service Fast Learn Adapts - 6L50/6L80/6L90 - Automatic Transmission</h1><br><br><b>Service Fast Learn Adapts</b><br><br>Service Fast Learn Adapts is a procedure for 6 speed automatic transmissions in which a series of tests are run to allow the transmission control module (TCM) to learn individual clutch characteristics. Once the clutch data is learned, Service Fast Learn Adapts translates it into the adaptive data cells, which the <a href="2303.html">TCM</a> uses for clutch control during shifts. The scan tool provides initiation of the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure. This procedure is to be used following transmission repair. <br><br><br>The Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure must be performed when one of the following repairs have been made to the vehicle. Failure to perform the procedure after one of the following repairs may result in poor transmission performance, as well as transmission DTCs being set:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission internal service/overhaul<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Valve body repair or replacement<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Control solenoid (w/body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly replacement<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="2303.html">TCM</a> software/calibration update<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Any service in response to a shift quality concern<br><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Ensure the following conditions are met before performing the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure:</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Drive wheels are blocked</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Parking brake is applied</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Service brake is applied</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Zero percent throttle and no external engine RPM control</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transmission fluid temperature (TFT) is between 70-100&deg;C (158-212&deg;F)</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transmission gear selector has been cycled from Park to Reverse 3 times in order to purge air from the reverse clutches.</b><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using the scan tool, navigate to Service Fast Learn Adapts commands.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>F1: Transmission Control Module<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>F5: Module Setup<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>F0: Fast Learn Adapts Process<br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>If at any time during the procedure, required conditions are not met, Service Fast Learn Adapts may abort and the process may need to be started again from the beginning.</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the scan tool to perform the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>There are 3 stages required to successfully complete the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure:</b><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>PARK test setup<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>DRIVE mode<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>REVERSE mode<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>These stages are automatically initiated and controlled by the scan tool. As the procedure is being performed, the scan tool data display will provide operator instructions. Follow the scan tool instructions as required. For a brief description of each stage, refer to PARK Test Setup, DRIVE Mode, and REVERSE Mode below.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Once the procedure is complete, shut OFF the engine and power down the <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>. You will lose communication to the scan tool.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Restart the engine. This will complete the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure.<br><br><br>The following are brief descriptions of each of the 3 different stages.<br><br><br><b>PARK Test Setup</b><br><br>While the transmission is in PARK, Service Fast Learn Adapts will prepare for test cycles. The test preparation will include the diagnostic criteria checks, safety checks, vehicle status checks, and then will perform internal transmission test preparation functions such as clutch air purging. The scan tool will instruct the operator to select park and apply the brake only.<br><br><br><b>DRIVE Mode</b><br><br><b>Caution:</b>  Block the wheels before selecting DRIVE. While in DRIVE, if the Scan Tool loses communication or becomes disconnected, the vehicle could move forward. Failure to block the wheels could result in personal injury or property damage.<br><br><br>Once the PARK setup has completed, the scan tool instructs the driver to select DRIVE. Once DRIVE is selected, the <a href="2303.html">TCM</a> engages the individual clutches to learn the clutch volume, full feed fill thresholds, and pressure offsets. The TCM will only cycle through this test once. Running the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure multiple times will give the same results and is not necessary.<br><br><br><b>REVERSE Mode</b><br><br><b>Caution:</b>  Block the wheels before selecting REVERSE. While in REVERSE, if the Scan Tool loses communication or becomes disconnected, the vehicle could move backward. Failure to block the wheels could result in personal injury or property damage.<br><br><br>Next, the scan tool instructs the driver to select REVERSE. The <a href="2303.html">TCM</a> engages the individual clutches to learn the clutch volume, full feed fill thresholds, and pressure offsets. The TCM will only cycle through this test one time. Running the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure multiple times will give the same results.<br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>When the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure is completed, the transmission will remain in a neutral state.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>Troubleshooting</b><br><br>If the Service Fast Learn Adapts will not run and the above stated conditions have been met, ensure the following:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>TFT is between 70-100&deg;C (158-212&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Brakes and brake switch are functioning properly.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No active DTCs.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Closed throttle and engine RPM increases above 1500 RPM while in Park Test Setup or at entrance of the test modes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Park/Neutral position switch is properly adjusted and functioning.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Line pressure control is able to provide 1000 kPa and is within specifications.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle is not moving, or vibrating excessively.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clutches are properly assembled.<br><br><br></div>
