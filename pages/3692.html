<h1>Automatic HVAC Description and Operation (Part 2)</h1><br><br><b>Automatic HVAC Description and Operation (Part 2)</b><br><br><b><a href="24.html">Blower Motor Relay</a></b><br><br>The <a href="24.html">blower motor relay</a> provides a supply voltage to the <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> and blower motor control processor. The HVAC control module commands the blower motor relay ON anytime the commanded blower speed is not OFF.<br><br><b><a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">Blower Motor</a> Control Processor</b><br><br>The <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> control processor is an interface between the HVAC control module and the blower motor. The blower motor speed control, blower motor supply voltage and ground circuits enable the control processor to operate. The HVAC control module provides a PWM signal to the control processor in order to command the blower motor speed. The control processor uses the blower motor ground as a low side control to adjust the blower motor speed.<br><br><b>Afterblow</b><br><br>Afterblow is a feature that dries the <a href="3666.html">evaporator core</a> by operating the <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> after the engine is turned off. This reduces the amount of microbial growth that can create undesirable odors. The vehicle does not come equipped with the afterblow feature turned on. If the afterblow feature is required due to an odor concern, it must be turned on by reprogramming the HVAC control module, refer to Service Programming System (SPS)  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) .<br><br>After the HVAC control module has been programmed for afterblow, the following conditions must be met for afterblow to operate:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine has been turned off for at least 30 minutes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ambient air temperature is at least 21&deg;C (70&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The A/C compressor operated for more than 2 minutes before shut down.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system voltage is at least 12 volts.<br><br><br>Once the above conditions have been met, the following sequence of events will occur:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> will RUN for 20 seconds.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> will be OFF for 10 minutes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> will RUN for and additional 20 seconds.<br><br><br><br><b>Auxiliary Air Speed</b><br><br>Auxiliary A/C has a <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> that is independent to that system.

If the passengers setting is turned off then the drivers setting controls both driver and passenger temperature actuators. The passengers setting can not be used without the drivers setting also being ON. The passengers setting can be turned ON or OFF by pressing the power button in the center of the passengers temperature rocker switch. When the passengers setting is ON, the passenger temperature can be adjusted independently from the drivers setting and the passenger temperature is displayed on the passengers side of the control module. A different sunload on one side of the vehicle may cause different discharge air temperatures even when the passengers setting is not turned ON.<br><br><b>Air Distribution</b><br><br>The HVAC control module controls the mode actuator in order to distribute airflow to a desired outlet. The mode switch provides the vehicle operator with the ability to override the automatic setting. When the mode door is moved to the defrost position, the A/C compressor clutch engages and the recirculation actuator will be moved to the outside air position. In the outside air position, the incoming air is filtered by the passenger compartment air filter. <br><br>The HVAC system allows air to the outboard panel outlets in all air distribution modes. This allows air to be circulated higher in the cabin under any operating condition. The panel outlets have three operating positions, open, side window defogger and closed. To eliminate air from these outlets, the individual outlet thumb wheel must be turned to the OFF or side window defogger position.<br><br><b>Recirculation</b><br><br>The HVAC control module controls the air intake through the recirculation actuator. Recirculation is not available when the mode is in defrost. When the mode is in defog, Recirculation will only be available for 10 minutes. In the outside air position, the incoming air is filtered by the passenger compartment air filter. <br><br><br><b>Automatic Operation</b><br><br>In automatic operation, the HVAC control module will maintain the comfort level inside of the vehicle by controlling the A/C compressor clutch, the <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a>, the air temperature actuators, mode actuator and recirculation.<br><br><br>To place the HVAC system in automatic mode, the following is required:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="92.html">blower motor switch</a> must be in the AUTO position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The air temperature switch must be in any other position other than 60 or 90 degrees.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The mode switch must be in the AUTO position.<br><br><br>Once the desired temperature is reached, the <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a>, mode, recirculation and temperature actuators will automatically adjust to maintain the temperature selected. The HVAC control module performs the following functions to maintain the desired air temperature:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Regulate <a href="0.html#Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning/Blower%20Motor/">blower motor</a> speed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the air temperature actuator<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the mode actuator<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the recirculation actuator<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Request A/C operation<br><br><br>When the warmest position is selected in automatic operation the blower speed will increase gradually until the vehicle reaches normal operating temperature. When normal operating temperature is reached the blower will stay on high speed and the air temperature actuators will stay in the full heat position. <br><br><br>When the coldest position is selected in automatic operation the blower will stay on high and the air temperature actuators will stay in the full cold position. The mode actuator will remain in the panel position and the recirculation actuator will remain in the recirculation position.<br><br><br>In cold temperatures, the automatic HVAC system will provide heat in the most efficient manner. The vehicle operator can select an extreme temperature setting but the system will not warm the vehicle any faster. In warm temperatures, the automatic HVAC system will also provide air conditioning in the most efficient manner. Selecting an extreme cool temperature will not cool the vehicle any faster.<br><br><br><b>A/C Cycle</b><br><br><a href="325.html">Refrigerant</a> is the key element in an air conditioning system. R-134a is presently the only EPA approved refrigerant for automotive use. R-134a is an very low temperature gas that can transfer the undesirable heat and moisture from the passenger compartment to the outside air.<br><br><br>The Denso 10S20 fixed displacement swash plate A/C compressor is belt driven and operates when the magnetic clutch is engaged. The compressor builds pressure on the vapor <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a>. Compressing the refrigerant also adds heat to the refrigerant. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor, through the discharge hose, and forced to flow to the condenser and then through the balance of the A/C system. The A/C system is mechanically protected with the use of a high pressure relief valve. If the high pressure switch were to fail or if the refrigerant system becomes restricted and refrigerant pressure continued to rise, the high pressure relief will pop open and release refrigerant from the system.<br><br><br>Compressed <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> enters the condenser in a high temperature, high pressure vapor state. As the refrigerant flows through the condenser, the heat of the refrigerant is transferred to the ambient air passing through the condenser. Cooling the refrigerant causes the refrigerant to condense and change from a vapor to a liquid state. <br><br><br>The condenser is located in front of the radiator for maximum heat transfer. The condenser is made of aluminum and aluminum cooling fins, which allows rapid heat transfer for the <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a>. The semi-cooled liquid refrigerant exits the condenser and flows through the liquid line, to the thermal expansion valve.<br><br><br>The thermal expansion valve is located in the liquid line between the condenser and the evaporator. The thermal expansion valve is the dividing point for the high and the low pressure sides of the A/C system. As the <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> passes through the thermal expansion valve, the pressure of the refrigerant is lowered. Due to the pressure differential of the liquid refrigerant, the refrigerant will begin to vaporize at the thermal expansion valve. The thermal expansion valve also meters the amount of liquid refrigerant that can flow into the evaporator.<br><br><br><a href="325.html">Refrigerant</a> exiting the thermal expansion valve flows into the <a href="3666.html">evaporator core</a> in a low pressure, liquid state. Ambient air is drawn through the HVAC module and passes through the evaporator core. Warm and moist air will cause the liquid refrigerant boil inside of the evaporator core. The boiling refrigerant absorbs heat from the ambient air and draws moisture onto the evaporator. The refrigerant exits the evaporator back through the thermal expansion valve and into the suction line and back to the compressor, in a vapor state completing the A/C cycle of heat removal. At the compressor, the refrigerant is compressed again and the cycle of heat removal is repeated.<br><br><br>The conditioned air is distributed through the HVAC module for passenger comfort. The heat and moisture removed from the passenger compartment will also change form, or condense, and is discharged from the HVAC module as water under the vehicle.<br></div>
