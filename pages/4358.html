If there are video or audio quality problems with an individual DVD, try playing that disk in another <a href="4184.html">DVD player</a>. If the quality is poor for both players, return the disk to the place of purchase and request an exchange. If the quality problem is only seen in one of the players, examine the disk for scratches dirt or smudges and attempt to clean the disk with one of the disk cleaning systems that are commercially available.<br><br><br>Video or audio distortion during auxiliary playback can often be attributed to the DC to AC inverter that is used to power the auxiliary device. The power inverters tend to introduce noisy signals into the vehicle electrical system.<br><br><br><b>Video Entertainment System Wireless Headphone Inoperative</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>The following information lists the most probable cause of the concern to the least probable cause followed by the appropriate test for that condition.</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Volume control on the wireless headphone set is turned all the way down.
