<h1>Vibration Diagnostic Aids - Vibration Duplicated, Component Not Identified</h1><br><br><b>Vibration Diagnostic Aids - Vibration Duplicated, Component Not Identified</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>If you have not completed the Vibration Analysis tables as indicated and reviewed Vibration Diagnostic Aids, refer to Vibration Diagnostic Aids </b> (<a href="5103.html">Vibration Diagnostic Aids</a>)<b> BEFORE proceeding.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>Aftermarket Add-On Accessories</b><br><br>Aftermarket accessories which have been added to the vehicle can actually transmit and magnify INHERENT component rotational frequencies, if the accessories were not installed correctly.<br><br><br>An accessory should be installed in such a way that it is isolated from becoming a possible transfer path into the rest of the vehicle. For example, if a set of running boards has been installed improperly and they are sensitive to a particular frequency of a rotating component, the running boards could begin to respond to the frequency and actually create a disturbance once the amplitude of the frequency reaches a high enough point , probably at a higher vehicle speed.<br><br><br>If the same set of running boards were installed properly-isolated properly-the transfer path would be removed and the disturbance would no longer be present.<br><br></div>
