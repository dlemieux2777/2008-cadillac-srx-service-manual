The control module will disable the fuel pump relay within 2 seconds unless the control module detects ignition reference pulses. The control module continues to enable the fuel pump relay as long as ignition reference pulses are detected. The control module disables the fuel pump relay within 2 seconds if ignition reference pulses cease to be detected and the ignition remains ON. <br><br><br>The fuel system is a semi-returnless design. The fuel pressure regulator is a part of the fuel sender assembly, eliminating the need for a return pipe from the engine. A semi-returnless fuel system reduces the internal temperature of the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> by not returning hot fuel from the engine to the fuel tank. Reducing the internal temperature of the fuel tank results in lower evaporative emissions. <br><br><br>The <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> stores the fuel supply. The <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> is an electric pump that is attached to the primary fuel tank module assembly. The fuel pump also supplies fuel to the siphon jet pump, also attached to the primary fuel tank module. The siphon jet pump draws fuel from the secondary side of the fuel tank to the primary side of the fuel tank. The fuel pump is designed to provide fuel at a pressure above the pressure that is needed by the fuel injectors. A fuel pressure regulator which is also located in the fuel tank, is attached to the primary fuel tank module. The fuel pressure regulator keeps the fuel available to the fuel injectors at a regulated pressure. Unused fuel is returned from the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Filter/">fuel filter</a> to the fuel tank by a separate fuel return pipe.<br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><br><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br>Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>)for scan tool information<br><b>Special Tools Required</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>CH-48027 Digital Pressure Gage<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>J 37287 Fuel Line Shut-off Adapter<br><br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Inspect the fuel system for damage or external leaks before proceeding.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Verify that adequate fuel is in the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> before proceeding.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>The <a href="38.html">fuel pump relay</a> may need to be commanded ON a few times in order to obtain the highest possible <a href="959.html">fuel pressure</a>.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Before proceeding with this test review the User Manual CH 48027-5 for Safety Information and Instructions.</b><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, engine OFF, command the <a href="38.html">fuel pump relay</a> ON with a scan tool.
