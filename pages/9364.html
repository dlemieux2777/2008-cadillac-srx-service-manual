<h1>Wheel Alignment Measurement</h1><br><br><b>Wheel Alignment Measurement</b><br><br>Steering and vibration complaints are not always the result of improper alignment. One possible cause is wheel and tire imbalance. Another possibility is tire lead due to worn or improperly manufactured <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>. Lead/pull is defined as follows: At a constant highway speed on a typical straight road, lead/pull is the amount of effort required at the steering wheel to maintain the vehicle's straight path. Lead is the vehicle deviation from a straight path on a level road without pressure on the steering wheel. Refer to Radial Tire Lead/Pull Correction  (<a href="3633.html">Radial Tire Lead/Pull Correction</a>) in order to determine if the vehicle has a tire lead problem.<br><br><br>Before performing any adjustment affecting wheel alignment, perform the following inspections and adjustments in order to ensure correct alignment readings:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> for the proper inflation and irregular tire wear.
