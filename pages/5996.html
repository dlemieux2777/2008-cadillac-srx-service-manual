<h1>Garage Door Opener Programming - Universal</h1><br><br><b>Garage Door Opener Programming - Universal</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Do not use the garage door opener (GDO) with any garage door opener that does not have the stop and reverse safety feature. This includes any garage door opener model manufactured before April 1, 1982.</b><br><br><br><b>Ensure that people and objects are clear of the garage door while performing programming operations.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>Programming the GDO for Rolling Code Receivers</b><br><br>This procedure will learn a rolling code garage door opener to the GDO transmitter. The learn process must be completed within 30 seconds.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the two outside buttons of the GDO for one to two seconds, then immediately release them.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Locate the "Learn" or "Smart" button on the garage door opener receiver (located on the garage door opener motor-head unit). It is often found where the hanging antenna wire is attached to the motor-head unit and may be a colored button. Refer to the garage door opener operator's manual or call 1-866-572-2728 for assistance. Press the "Learn" or "Smart" button. The garage door opener operator's manual may provide assistance in determining when the unit is in learn mode.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Immediately return to the GDO transmitter in the vehicle. Press and hold the button that is to be learned; the LED above the button will begin to flash slowly. When the garage door moves, immediately release the button. The LED will flash rapidly until programming is complete.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the button used during the learn operation again in order to verify that the GDO transmitter has been programmed.<br><br><br>The GDO is compatible with most, but not all, types of garage door openers. If the GDO LED does not flash rapidly after 90 seconds, there may be a compatibility conflict with the garage door opener. Call 1-866-572-2728 to address compatibility concerns.<br><br><br><b>Programming the GDO for Fixed Code Receivers</b><br><br>This procedure will learn a fixed code garage door opener to the GDO transmitter. To determine if the customer has a fixed code garage door opener, remove the battery cover on the customer supplied transmitter. If a row of dip switches is present, the garage door opener is a fixed code version. The transmitter should have anywhere from 8 to 12 switches. The garage door opener receiver may also have a set of dip switches. If the number of switches on the receiver and the transmitter do not match, use the receiver switches to program the GDO. Each dip switch may have either two or three positions. The two position switch can either be ON or OFF. The three position switch can either be ON, NEUTRAL, or OFF.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Write down the positions of the dip switches. The positions of the switches will be entered from left to right into the GDO using the three buttons.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press all three buttons on the GDO for three seconds and immediately release them. The LEDs should flash slowly, indicating that the GDO is in programming mode.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Enter the positions of the dip switches one at a time. If a position of a dip switch is on, press the left button on the GDO. If the position is neutral, press the middle button of the GDO. If the position is off, press the right button of the GDO. Enter all of the positions of the dip switches. The procedure must be completed in two and a half minutes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and hold all three buttons on the GDO until all the LEDs turn on.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and hold the button that is to be learned; the LED above the button will begin to flash slowly. When the garage door moves, immediately release the button. The LED will flash rapidly until programming is complete.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the button used during the learn operation again in order to verify that the GDO transmitter has been programmed.<br><br><br>The GDO is compatible with most, but not all, types of garage door openers. If the GDO light does not flash rapidly after 90 seconds, there may be a compatibility conflict with the garage door opener. Call 1-866-572-2728 to address compatibility concerns.<br><br><br><b>Erasing Channels</b><br><br>To erase programmed channels, press and hold the two outside buttons until the lights on the GDO transmitter begins to flash. Once the LEDs begin to flash, release both buttons; all learned codes are now erased.<br><br><br>Individual channels cannot be erased, but can be reprogrammed using the procedures above.<br><br></div>
