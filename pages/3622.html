<h1>Removal and Replacement</h1><br><br><b>Tire Mounting and Dismounting</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Use a tire changing machine in order to dismount <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>. Do not use hand tools or tire irons alone in order to remove the tire from the wheel. Damage to the tire beads or the wheel rim could result.<br><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Do not scratch or damage the clear coating on aluminum <a href="3624.html">wheels</a> with the tire changing equipment. Scratching the clear coating could cause the aluminum wheel to corrode and the clear coating to peel from the wheel.<br><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b>  Damage to either the tire bead or the wheel mounting holes can result from the use of improper wheel attachment or tire mounting procedures. It takes up to 70 seconds for all of the air to completely exhaust from a large tire. Failure to follow the proper procedures could cause the tire changer to put enough force on the tire to bend the wheel at the mounting surface. Such damage may result in vibration and/or shimmy, and under severe usage lead to wheel cracking.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the valve core from the valve stem.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Deflate the tire completely.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>Rim-clamp European-type tire changers are recommended.</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the tire changer in order to remove the tire from the wheel. Follow steps 4-7 to remove the tire from the wheel.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/150795136.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When Separating the tire bead from the wheel, position the bead breaking fixture 90, 180 and 270 degrees from the valve stem.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/150800128.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the wheel and tire so the valve stem is situated at the 2 o'clock position relative to the head.

If any tire sealant is noted upon tire dismounting on vehicles equipped with TPM, replace the <a href="3604.html">tire pressure sensor</a>. Refer to Tire Pressure Indicator Sensor Replacement (Snap In Style)  (<a href="7918.html">Tire Pressure Indicator Sensor Replacement (Snap In Style)</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use a wire brush or coarse steel wool in order to remove any rubber, light rust or corrosion from the wheel bead seats.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b>  When mounting the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>, use an approved tire mounting lubricant. DO NOT use silicon or corrosive base compounds to lubricate the tire bead and the wheel rim. A silicon base compound can cause the tire to slip on the rim. A corrosive type compound can cause tire or rim deterioration.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply GM P/N 12345884 (Canadian P/N 5728223,) or equivalent to the tire bead and the wheel rim.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/150811698.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the rim so the valve stem (1) is situated at the 3 o'clock position relative to the head (2).

This will protect the sensor while mounting the tire bead to the outside of the wheel.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/150829926.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the tire changer in order to install the tire to the wheel.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Caution:</b>  To avoid serious personal injury, do not stand over tire when inflating. The bead may break when the bead snaps over the safety hump. Do not exceed 275 kPa (40 psi) pressure when inflating any tire if beads are not seated. If 275 kPa (40 psi) pressure will not seat the beads, deflate, relubricate the beads and reinflate. Overinflation may cause the bead to break and cause serious personal injury.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>14.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflate the tire until it passes the bead humps. Be sure that the valve core is not installed at this time.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>15.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the valve core to the valve core stem.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflate the tire to the proper air pressure.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>17.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the locating rings are visible on both sides of the tire in order to verify that the tire bead is fully seated on the wheel.<br><br><br></div>
