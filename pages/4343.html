It is powered by a fused, battery voltage circuit connected through the vehicle wiring to the 3-button assembly and the radio, and attached by means of coax cables to the cellular and navigation antennas. Ground for the module is accomplished by means of dedicated circuits that are routed with body wiring systems to chassis ground points. The module houses 2 modems, one to process <a href="4190.html">global positioning system</a> (GPS) data, and the other for cellular information. Satellites orbiting earth are constantly transmitting signals of their current location, from which the OnStar(R) system is able to pinpoint its own location. The navigation antenna receives these GPS signals and provides the data to the VCIM to be processed. The VCIM communicates with the rest of the vehicle over the class 2 or GMLAN serial data bus, depending upon the serial data architecture of the vehicle. The ignition state is determined by the VCIM through class 2 or GMLAN messaging. The module also has the capability of commanding the horn, initiating door lock/unlock and operating the exterior lamps using the serial data circuits. When an OnStar(R) keypress is made, a serial data message is sent to the audio system to mute all radio functions and transmit OnStar(R) originated audio. After the audio system is muted, the OnStar(R) signals are transmitted to the audio system on the cellular telephone voice signal circuit, and returned to the module on the cellular telephone voice low reference circuit. The cellular modem connects the OnStar(R) system to the cellular carriers communication system by interacting with the national cellular infrastructure. The module sends and receives all cellular communications over the cellular antenna and cellular antenna coax.<br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br>OnStar Schematics  (<a href="6610.html">OnStar Schematics</a>)<br><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br>Component Connector End Views  (<a href="0.html#Diagrams/Connector%20Views/">Connector Views</a>)<br><b>Description and Operation</b><br><br>OnStar Description and Operation  (<a href="4322.html">OnStar Description and Operation</a>)<br><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><br><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br>Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) for scan tool information<br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Perform this diagnostic if the OnStar(R) Call Center operator can clearly be heard but the operator is unable to hear the caller.</b><br><br><br><br>Ignition ON, press the OnStar(R) Call button.
