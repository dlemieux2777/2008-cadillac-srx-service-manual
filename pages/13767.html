Also, joining together emphasized that low detergency is an issue of concern to several automotive companies.<br><br><b>What are the benefits of TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline?</b><br><br>TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline will help keep engines cleaner than gasoline containing the "Lowest Additive Concentration" set by the EPA. Clean engines help provide optimal fuel economy and performance and reduced emissions.
