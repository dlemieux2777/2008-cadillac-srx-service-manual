<h1>Audible Warnings Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Audible Warnings Description and Operation</b><br><br>The audible warnings alert the driver of a system concern or a critical vehicle condition. The audio amplifier generates the audible warnings through the speaker. The audio amplifier receives audible warning request via the serial data circuit from the instrument panel cluster (IPC). If the audio amplifier receives multiple audible warning requests, the warning with the highest priority sounds first. The following lists the audible warning priority and the pulse rate:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fast rate chime-200 pulses per minute<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Medium rate chime-150 pulses per minute<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Slow rate chime-50 pulses per minute<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Single chime<br><br><br><br><b>Fasten Safety Belt Warning</b><br><br>The audio amplifier activates the fasten safety belt audible warning as requested by the instrument panel cluster (IPC). The IPC sends a serial data message to the audio amplifier indicating the chime frequency and duration. The fasten safety belt warning sounds and the fasten safety belt indicator illuminates when the following occurs:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch transitions to ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) detects that the driver's seat belt is not buckled and the signal is low. The SDM sends a serial data message to the IPC indicating the seat belt status. <br><br><br>If the seat belt is buckled when the ignition is turned ON, the chime does not sound. If the seat belt is buckled while the chime is sounding, the chime stops. If the seat belt is unbuckled after the initial transition to ON, the chime does not sound.<br><br><br><b>Lights On Warning</b><br><br>The audio amplifier activates the lights on warning as requested by the instrument panel cluster (IPC). The IPC sends a serial data message to the audio amplifier indicating the chime frequency and duration. The lights on warning sounds when the following occurs:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The body control module (BCM) determines that the driver door is open and the signal circuit is low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the headlamp switch is in the park or head position.<br><br><br><br><b>Brake Warning</b><br><br>The audio amplifier activates the brake audible warning as requested by the instrument panel cluster (IPC). The IPC sends a serial data message to the audio amplifier indicating the chime frequency and duration. The brake warning sounds and the BRAKE indicator illuminates when the following occurs:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed is greater than 8 km/h (4.9 mph). The IPC receives a serial data message from the engine control module (ECM) indicating the vehicle speed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The IPC determines that the park brake is engaged and the signal circuit is low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The brake fluid is low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The dynamic rear proportioning (DRP) failed<br><br><br><br><b>Key-In-Ignition Warning</b><br><br>The audio amplifier activates the key-in-ignition audible warning as requested by the BCM. The BCM sends a serial data message to the radio indicating the chime frequency and duration. The key-in-ignition warning sounds when the following occurs:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the driver door is open and the signal circuit is low. The IPC also receives a serial data message from the BCM indicating the door ajar status<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the key-in-ignition switch is open and the signal circuit is high. <br><br><br><br><b>Door Ajar Warning</b><br><br>The audio amplifier activates the door ajar audible warning as requested by the body control module (BCM). The BCM sends a serial data message to the radio indicating the chime frequency and duration. The door ajar warning sounds and the door ajar indicator illuminates when the following occurs:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the driver door is open and the signal circuit is low. The instrument panel cluster (IPC) also receives a serial data message from the BCM requesting illumination of the door ajar indicator.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is not in PARK. The BCM receives a serial data message from the ECM/BCM indicating the gear position.<br><br><br><br><b>Additional Warnings</b><br><br>The following warnings have an associated instrument panel cluster (IPC) indicator:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Hot coolant temperature-The audio amplifier activates the audible warning as requested by the body control module (BCM) or the ECM. The IPC sends a serial data message to the audio amplifier indicating the chime frequency and duration.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Low fuel-The audio amplifier activates the audible warning as requested by the IPC. The IPC sends a serial data message to the audio amplifier indicating the chime frequency and duration.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Low engine oil pressure-The audio amplifier activates the audible warning as requested by the IPC. The IPC sends a serial data message to the audio amplifier indicating the chime frequency and duration. The low engine oil pressure indicator will be ON in the IPC.<br><br><br>Refer to Indicator/Warning Message Description and Operation  (<a href="5219.html">Indicator/Warning Message Description and Operation</a>) .<br><br></div>
