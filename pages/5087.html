<h1>Vibrate Software Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Vibrate Software Description and Operation</b><br><br>The J 38792-VS  , Vibrate Software, is a computer software program which is designed to be used in support of the Vibration Analysis diagnostic tables, along with the J 38792-A  , Electronic Vibration Analyzer (EVA) and a scan tool, to help in determining the source of a vibration concern. The J 38792-VS  is designed to provide quick calculations and produce a chart of the rotational speeds and frequency ranges for specific vehicle systems and components, based upon vehicle data parameters inputted by the user.<br><br><br>The J 38792-VS  uses the vehicle data parameters, such as axle ratio, number of engine cylinders, etc. to create the base chart, depicting the relationships of the various vehicle systems and/or components. The chart view can be modified to show data related to vehicle speed only, engine speed only, or both vehicle speed and engine speed. The user can then plot the dominant frequency reading obtained on the J 38792-A  which correlates with the vibration concern, and the engine RPM obtained on a scan tool which correlates with the concern. Once these pieces of data are correctly plotted, the chart will point to the source of the vibration concern, which should confirm the results obtained through the following the Vibration Analysis diagnostic tables.<br><br></div>
