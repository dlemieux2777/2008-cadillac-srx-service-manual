The switches consist of 2 positions, lock and unlock, and are in the normally open state. When placed in either the lock or unlock positions, the switches provide a direct input to there respective door control module. When a power door lock switch is operated to the lock or unlock position, the associated door control module responds by sending a GMLAN serial data message indicating a change in the switch's position. This serial data message is received by the opposite door control module as well as the body control module (BCM). The DDM and PDM respond to the lock/unlock request by activating there associated power door lock motors to the appropriate direction to lock or unlock the front doors. The <a href="34.html">BCM</a> is responsible for controlling the left and right rear passenger door lock motors. The BCM, upon receipt of a lock or unlock serial data signal, will control either the rear door lock or unlock relay. When the appropriate <a>door lock relay</a> is energized, the rear power door lock motors will lock or unlock the rear doors.<br><br><br><b>Door Lock and Unlock Motor Operation</b><br><br>The power door lock motors are contained within each door lock actuator assembly. The driver door module (DDM) and passenger <a href="13.html">door module</a> (PDM) each supply battery voltage and ground through there respective door lock and unlock actuator control circuits to its associated door lock actuator motor. The power door lock motors are reversible and are responsible for both the locking and unlocking functions of the associated door. When the door control modules receive a locking request, the modules will respond by momentarily applying voltage to the door lock actuator lock control circuit, and ground to the door lock actuator unlock control circuit. To unlock the front doors, the door control modules reverse the polarity by momentarily applying voltage to the door lock actuator unlock control circuit, and ground to the door lock actuator lock control circuit.<br><br><br>The left and right rear power door locks are controlled by the body control module (BCM). The <a href="34.html">BCM</a>, upon receipt of a lock or unlock signal, will control the rear door lock or unlock relay, activating the power door lock motors in the appropriate direction to lock or unlock the rear doors. When the BCM receives a locking request, the BCM energizes the lock relay by applying voltage to the lock relay coil via the <a>door lock relay</a> control circuit. With the lock relay energized, battery voltage flows through the relay controlled output circuit to both rear door lock motors causing both rear doors to lock. Ground for both rear door lock motors is supplied by the rear door unlock relay controlled output circuit. With the rear door unlock relay in a nonenergized state, the switch contacts are in a normally closed state with a path to a ground. For a rear door unlock function, the BCM energizes the unlock relay by applying ground to the unlock relay coil via the door unlock relay control circuit. The rear door unlock relay coil is supplied with battery voltage at all times. With the unlock relay energized, battery voltage flows through the relay controlled output circuit to both rear door lock motors causing both rear doors to unlock. Ground for both rear door unlock motors is supplied by the rear door lock relay controlled output circuit. With the rear door lock relay in a nonenergized state, the switch contacts are in a normally closed state with a path to a ground.<br><br><br><b>Power Door Lock Deadbolt Motors (European)</b><br><br>European vehicles may be equipped with the deadbolt feature, which includes a reversible deadbolt motor contained within each door lock actuator assembly. Each front door deadbolt motor is wired to the associated door control module through 2 circuits; the deadbolt motor lock control circuit and the deadbolt motor unlock control circuit. To deadbolt a door, the <a href="13.html">door module</a> locks the door by momentarily applying voltage to the door lock motor lock control circuit, and ground to the door lock motor unlock control circuit. To complete the deadbolting, the door module then momentarily applies voltage to the deadbolt motor control circuit and ground to the door lock motor unlock control circuit. Once the door is deadbolted, the mechanical lock/unlock linkage within the door lock actuator is physically disconnected so that the door can not be manually unlocked. If the content theft feature is armed at the same time, the interior door lock switches will not operate the locks.<br><br><br>To undeadbolt the front doors, the <a href="13.html">door modules</a> reverses the polarity, applying battery voltage to the deadbolt motor unlock control circuit, and ground to the deadbolt motor control circuit.<br><br><br>The deadbolt motors for the rear doors are controlled by the body control module (BCM). The <a href="34.html">BCM</a> uses 2 controls circuits; the deadbolt motor lock control circuit and the deadbolt motor unlock control circuit to activate the rear door deadbolts. The deadbolt motor lock control circuit is wired to the rear <a>door lock relay</a> coil side. To deadbolt the rear doors, the BCM locks the doors by momentarily applying voltage to the deadbolt motor lock control circuit. This energizes the rear door lock relay coil causing the switch contacts to close allowing battery voltage to be applied to the rear door lock and deadbolt motors. Ground for both motors is supplied through the door lock motor unlock circuit through the normally closed contacts of the unlock relay to ground. Once the door is deadbolted, the mechanical lock/unlock linkage within the door lock actuator is physically disconnected so that the door can not be manually unlocked.<br><br><br>To undeadbolt the rear doors, the <a href="34.html">BCM</a> unlocks the doors by momentarily applying ground to the deadbolt motor unlock control circuit. This energizes the rear door unlock relay coil causing voltage to flow through the switch contacts to the rear door lock and deadbolt motors. Ground for both motors is supplied through the door lock motor lock circuit through the normally closed contacts of the lock relay to ground. Once the door is deadbolted, the mechanical lock/unlock linkage within the door lock actuator is physically disconnected so that the door can not be manually unlocked.<br><br><br><b>Central Door Unlock</b><br><br>The vehicle may be equipped with the central door unlock feature. With this feature, all doors can be unlocked from the driver door using the door <a href="2852.html">key</a>. To operate the feature, the door key is inserted into the driver <a href="4643.html">door lock cylinder</a>, turned to the unlock position and held for 3 seconds or longer, or turned to the unlock position twice within 3 seconds. A mechanical linkage rod connects the driver door lock cylinder to the key cylinder unlock switch, which is built into the driver door latch assembly. The key cylinder unlock switch contacts, which are normally open, receive a constant ground via the ground circuit. When the door key is turned to unlock, the switch contacts close and the driver door module (DDM) detects a switched ground. The DDM sends a message via GMLAN serial data to the remote control door lock receiver (RCDLR), indicating the key cylinder unlock switch request. The RCDLR is the master of all lock and unlock operations. If the RCDLR determines that the key cylinder switch request is valid and conditions are correct, a message via GMLAN serial data will be sent to the DDM, PDM, and <a href="34.html">BCM</a> to lock or unlock there respective doors. <br><br><br><b>Automatic Door Locks</b><br><br>The automatic door lock feature provides for the locking and unlocking of all the doors automatically when shifting the transmission. When the vehicle doors are closed, ignition turned ON, and the transmission is shifted out of PARK, all doors will lock. When the vehicle is stopped and the transmission is shifted into PARK, the doors will unlock.<br><br><br>Operation of the automatic door lock system depends upon door status information gathered by the body control module (BCM), and examined by the remote control door lock receiver (RCDLR). The system will not operate properly if the RCDLR, which is the door lock master, detects that a vehicle door is open. Each door latch contains a door open switch. Each door open switch receives voltage from the <a href="34.html">BCM</a> and are grounded independently. When a door is open, the switch closes, voltage flows through the switch, and the BCM interprets the flow of voltage as a door open input. The BCM sends this information over the GMLAN serial data circuit where it is detected by the RCDLR. If the RCDLR determines that one of the vehicle doors is open, automatic door locking will not be permitted.<br><br><br>Automatic door locking is programmed during the manufacturing process, but it can be custom programmed by the operator to fit individual preferences. For information concerning custom programming available and programming instructions, refer to the vehicles owners manual.<br><br><br><b>Lockout Prevention</b><br><br>This feature prevents the locking of the driver door if the ignition <a href="2852.html">key</a> is left in the ignition lock cylinder. If a lock function occurs from any door lock switch and the body control module (BCM) senses an active state on either the left front door latch signal, secondary door latch switch signal and/or the liftgate ajar switch signal circuits and the key in ignition switch signal circuit is in the YES state, the <a href="34.html">BCM</a>, driver door module (DDM) and passenger <a href="13.html">door module</a> (PDM) will lock the doors and then the DDM will unlock the driver door.<br><br><br><b>Delayed Locking Operation</b><br><br>With any door open and a door lock switch is activated in the lock position, the driver door module (DDM), passenger <a href="13.html">door module</a> (PDM) and the body control module (BCM) will go into a lock pending state. The <a href="34.html">BCM</a> will also give 3 audible chimes. When the door is closed, the DDM, PDM and the BCM will lock the doors after approximately 5 seconds. This feature can be overridden by activating the door lock switch a second time and the doors will lock even with a door open.<br><br><br><b>Door Ajar Indicator</b><br><br>The driver door module (DDM) and passenger <a href="13.html">door module</a> (PDM) each receive a discrete input from there respective door ajar switch signal circuits. The body control module (BCM) receives discrete inputs from each of the rear door ajar switch signal circuits. The door ajar switches are integral to each door latch assembly. When a door is opened, the normally open door ajar switch closes. With the door ajar switch closed, ground is provided to the door ajar switch signal circuit. The door control modules and/or <a href="34.html">BCM</a> interprets this and communicates via GMLAN serial data with the instrument panel cluster (IPC). When a door is open/ajar and the vehicle is in any gear other than PARK, the driver information center (DIC) will display DOOR AJAR for the appropriate door that is opened. If the door is still ajar and the vehicles speed is greater than 4.8 km/h (3 mph) a chime will sound.<br><br></div>
