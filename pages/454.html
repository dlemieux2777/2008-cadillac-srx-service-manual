<h1>129000 MI or 206400 KM</h1><b>Lubricate</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doors<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lubricate body components. Lubricate all key lock cylinders, hood latch assembly, secondary latch, pivots, spring anchor, release pawl, rear compartment hinges, outer liftgate handle pivot points, rear door detent link, roller mechanism, liftgate handle pivot points, latch bolt, fuel door hinge, cargo door hinge, locks and folding seat hardware. More frequent lubrication may be required when exposed to a corrosive environment. Applying silicone grease on weather-strips with a clean cloth will make them last longer, seal better and not stick or squeak.</i><br><b>Inspect</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiper Blade<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Visually inspect the wiper blades for wear or cracking. Replace all blade inserts that appear worn or damaged or that streak or miss areas of the windshield.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washer Fluid<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Check windshield washer fluid level and add fluid as needed.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicle<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Visually check for any leaks or damage. A fluid loss in any vehicle system could indicate a problem. Have the system inspected and repaired and the fluid level checked. Add fluid if needed.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Inspect suspension and steering components. Visually inspect front and rear suspension and steering system for damaged, loose, or missing parts, signs of wear or lack of lubrication. Inspect power steering lines and hoses for proper hook-up, binding, leaks, cracks, chafing, etc. Pickup models: Visually check constant velocity joints, rubber boots, and axle seals for leaks.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restraints and Safety Systems<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Inspect restraint system components. Make sure the safety belt reminder light and all your belts, buckles, latch plates, retractors and anchorages are working properly. Look for any other loose or damaged safety belt system parts. If you see anything that might keep a safety belt system from doing its job, have it repaired.  Have any torn or frayed safety belts replaced. Also look for any opened or broken air bag coverings, and have them repaired or replaced. The air bag system does not need regular maintenance.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooling System<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Inspect engine cooling system. Visually inspect hoses and have them replaced if they are cracked, swollen or deteriorated. Inspect all pipes, fittings and clamps. To help ensure proper operation, a pressure test of the cooling system and pressure cap and cleaning the outside of the radiator and air conditioning condenser is recommended at least once a year.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coolant<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Check engine coolant fluid level and add fluid as needed.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brakes and Traction Control<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Inspect Brake System. Visually inspect brake lines and hoses for proper hook-up, binding, leaks, cracks, chafing, etc. Inspect disc brake pads for wear and rotors for surface condition. Inspect other brake parts, including calipers, parking brake, etc.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Filter Element<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Inspect engine air cleaner filter. If necessary, replace filter. If you drive regularly under dusty conditions, inspect the filter, at each engine oil change.</i><br><b>Replace</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil Filter, Engine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engine Oil<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Change engine oil and filter, or every 12 months whichever occurs first. Reset the oil life system.</i><br><b>Rotate</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tires<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rotate tires and check inflation pressures and wear.</i><br></div>
