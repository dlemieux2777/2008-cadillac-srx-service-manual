<h1>Refrigerant Recovery and Recharging</h1><br><br><b><a href="325.html">Refrigerant</a> Recovery and Recharging</b><br><br><br><b>Tools Required</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>J 43600 ACR 2000 Air Conditioning Service Center<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>J 45037 A/C Oil Injector<br><br><br><b>Caution:</b>  Avoid breathing the A/C <a href="325.html">Refrigerant</a> 134a (R-134a) and the lubricant vapor or the mist. Exposure may irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. Work in a well ventilated area. In order to remove R-134a from the A/C system, use service equipment that is certified to meet the requirements of SAE J 2210 (R-134a recycling equipment). If an accidental system discharge occurs, ventilate the work area before continuing service. Additional health and safety information may be obtained from the refrigerant and lubricant manufacturers.<br><br><br><b>Caution:</b>  For personal protection, goggles and gloves should be worn and a clean cloth wrapped around fittings, valves, and connections when doing work that includes opening the <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> system. If R-134a comes in contact with any part of the body severe frostbite and personal injury can result. The exposed area should be flushed immediately with cold water and prompt medical help should be obtained.<br><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  R-134a is the only approved <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> for use in this vehicle. The use of any other refrigerant may result in poor system performance or component failure.<br><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  To avoid system damage use only R-134a dedicated tools when servicing the A/C system.<br><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Use only Polyalkylene Glycol Synthetic <a href="326.html">Refrigerant Oil</a> (PAG) for internal circulation through the R-134a A/C system and only 525 viscosity mineral oil on fitting threads and O-rings. If lubricants other than those specified are used, compressor failure and/or fitting seizure may result.<br><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  R-12 <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> and R-134a refrigerant must never be mixed, even in the smallest of amounts, as they are incompatible with each other. If the refrigerants are mixed, compressor failure is likely to occur. Refer to the manufacturer instructions included with the service equipment before servicing.<br><br><br>The J 43600  is a complete air conditioning service center for R-134a. The ACR 2000 recovers, recycles, evacuates and recharges A/C <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> quickly, accurately and automatically. The unit has a display screen that contains the function controls and displays prompts that will lead the technician through the recover, recycle, evacuate and recharge operations. R-134a is recovered into and charged out of an internal storage vessel. The ACR 2000 automatically replenishes this vessel from an external source tank in order to maintain a constant 5.45-6.82 kg (12-15 lbs) of A/C refrigerant.<br><br><br>The ACR 2000 has a built in A/C <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> identifier that will test for contamination, prior to recovery and will notify the technician if there are foreign gases present in the A/C system. If foreign gases are present, the ACR 2000 will not recover the refrigerant from the A/C system.<br><br><br>The ACR 2000 also features automatic air purge, single pass recycling and an automatic oil drain.<br><br><br>Refer to the J 43600  ACR 2000 manual for operation and setup instruction. Always recharge the A/C System with the proper amount of R-134a. Refer to <a href="325.html">Refrigerant</a> System Capacities  (<a href="3788.html">[1]</a><a href="7106.html">[2]</a><a>Capacity Specifications</a>) for the correct amount.<br><br><br><b>A/C <a href="325.html">Refrigerant</a> System Oil Charge Replenishing</b><br><br>If oil was removed from the A/C system during the recovery process or due to component replacement, the oil must be replenished. Oil can be injected into a charged system using J 45037  . For the proper quantities of oil to add to the A/C <a href="325.html">refrigerant</a> system, refer to Refrigerant System Capacities  (<a href="3788.html">[1]</a><a href="7106.html">[2]</a><a>Capacity Specifications</a>) .<br><br></div>
