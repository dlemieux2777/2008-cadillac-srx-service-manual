<h1>Drive/Propeller Shaft: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Propeller Shaft Description and Operation</b><br><br>The propeller shaft is a tube with joints at both ends which do not require periodic maintenance, that transmit power from the <a href="0.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Transfer%20Case/">transfer case</a> or transmission output shaft to the differential.<br><br><br><b>Two-Piece Propeller Shaft Description</b><br><br>There are 2 universal joints used on the two-piece propeller shaft. A center bearing assembly is used to support the propeller shaft connection point, and help isolate the vehicle from vibration.<br><br><br><b>Propeller Shaft Phasing Description</b><br><br>The propeller shaft is designed and built with the yoke lugs, ears, in line with each other. This produces the smoothest running shaft possible. A propeller shaft designed with built in yoke lugs in line is known as in-phase. An out of phase propeller shaft often causes vibration. The propeller shaft generates vibration from speeding up and slowing down each time the universal joint goes around. The vibration is the same as a person snapping a rope and watching the wave reaction flow to the end. An in phase propeller shaft is similar to 2 persons snapping a rope at the same time and watching the waves meet and cancel each other out. A total cancellation of vibration produces a smooth flow of power in the driveline.<br><br><br><b>Universal Joint Description (RWD Only)</b><br><br>The universal joint is connected to the propeller shaft. The universal consist of 4 caps with needle bearings and grease seals mounted on the trunnions of a cross or spider. These bearings and caps are greased at the factory and no periodic maintenance is required. There are 2 universal joints used in a two-piece propeller shaft. The bearings and caps are pressed into the yokes and staked in place. Universal joints are designed to handle the effects of various loads and rear axle windup conditions during acceleration and braking. The universal joint operates efficiently and safely within the designed angle variations. When the design angles are exceeded, the operational life of the joint decreases.<br><br><br><b>Center Bearing Description </b><br><br>Center bearings support the driveline when using 2 or more propeller shafts. The center bearing is a ball bearing mounted in a rubber cushion that attaches to a frame crossmember. The manufacturer prelubricates and seals the bearing. The cushion allows vertical motion at the driveline and helps isolate the vehicle from vibration.<br><br></div>
