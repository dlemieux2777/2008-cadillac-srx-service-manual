<h1>Body - Squeeze Type Resistance Spot Welding/Equipment</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>03-08-98-002B<br><br><b>Date: </b>June 30, 2010<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Squeeze Type Resistance Spot Welding/Equipment<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2011 and Prior Passenger Cars and Trucks (Including Saturn)<br>2003-2010 HUMMER H2, H3<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 03-08-98-002A (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br>This bulletin provides guidelines for repair shops that wish to use squeeze type resistance spot welding (or simply, spot welding) as an alternative to MIG plug welding when performing collision repair procedures. The process of spot welding for attaching body panels and components has been around for many years and is similar to the production welding process used in assembly plants. Spot welding may be applicable in similar situations that are currently MIG plug welded.<br><br>The following are some of the benefits of spot welding:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Less heat or burn damage<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Less damage to corrosion protection<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drilling of holes not required<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Replication of the production weld appearance<br><br>Applicable components for this technology may be panels or components with flanges that are accessible with arms and tips supplied by the equipment manufacturer. Welds from this equipment should be applied on a one-for-one basis, next to the production welds.<br><br>Here are some of the important factors in proper welding with this equipment.<br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>Proper use and safety training for each user of the equipment is a must.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use equipment from companies that are able to produce welds that meet industry standards for size and strength.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Equipment most likely to meet those standards at this time would be "inverter" technology and include the following suppliers (other suppliers may have comparable equipment):<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Pro Spot (PR2000)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Elektron (M100)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Blackhawk (WEL700)<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Car-O-Liner (CR500)<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>For specific information about this and other equipment, call GM Dealer Equipment.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the building power source is capable of meeting the equipment manufacturer's power requirement specifications.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For example, fuse 60 amp, 208-230 V single or 3-phase, using supply wire of sufficient gauge to carry the current load.
