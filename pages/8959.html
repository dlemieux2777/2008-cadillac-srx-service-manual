There are many different connector designs used on GM vehicles and it is sometimes difficult to identify the connector manufacturer. The information in this document should help with the identification of connector manufactures. <br><br><br>The following connector manufacturers make most of the connectors found in GM vehicles:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>AFL/EPC (Alcoa Fujikura Ltd./Engineered Plastics Components) <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Bosch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Delphi<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>FCI (Framatome Connectors International) <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>JAE (Japan Aviation Electronics)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>JST (Japan Solderless Terminals)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Kostel<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Molex<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Sumitomo<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tyco/AMP<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Yazaki<br><br><br>Identifying the manufacturer of a connector is often difficult. When trying to determine the manufacturer of a connector, look for specific identifying marks that are unique to that connector supplier. Most of these identify marks are hard to find or see. Check the connector carefully and refer to the information below for pictures and descriptions of connector identification markings. <br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65647888.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Most of AFLs connectors have EPC on their connector body. Some of the smaller connectors will not have any markings on them. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65648795.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In some cases Bosch will actually be printed on the connector. If Bosch does not appear on the connector, look for the Bosch logo. The Bosch logo is a circle with a blunted arrow inside. This logo can appear anywhere on the connector and is often very small. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65651432.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In some cases Delphi will actually be printed on the connector. If Delphi is not printed on the connector, look for PED. In both cases there is no specific orientation for Delphi or PED and they can appear anywhere on the connector. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65653047.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>FCI connectors may have the FCI logo on their connectors. The logo is the letters FCI with an "A" above it. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65653417.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>JAE connector have JAE in small letters on their connectors.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65656370.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>JST connectors have JST in small letters on their connectors, similar to that above. The location of the logo will vary with the connector size and style.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65658159.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Kostel has an "LK" with a circle around it.

In some cases the connectors may have MX followed by another letter. The third letter indicates where the connector was made. A connector with MXD is a Molex connector made in Detroit. <br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65664419.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Sumitomo has a unique symbol on their connector and possibly a part number. The symbol is similar to that of a diamond lying on its side, similar to that shown. The logo could appear anywhere but the most common place is at the wire side of the housing.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tyco/AMP has many different and unique connector designs. Some may or may not have identifiable marks on them.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/65667591.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Yazaki has a wedge or arrow shape, similar to that shown. <br><br><br></div>
