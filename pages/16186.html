Customer initiated Blue Button call, Emergency calls, and Automatic Crash Notification calls will also fail to establish a data connection with the OnStar(R) Call Center. Eventually, the customer's call will connect as a voice only line and the customer will be able to talk with an OnStar(R) advisor; however, the advisor will not get crucial customer data such as vehicle identification and location.<br><br><b>Correction</b><br><br>Dealers are to replace the OnStar(R) module (VCIM). <br><br><b>Vehicles Involved</b><br><br>Involved are <b>certain</b> 2002-2009 model year vehicles equipped with OnStar(R), and built within these VIN breakpoints: <br><br><b>Note:</b><br>Some model years/models have only one vehicle involved.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/56945202.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/56966440.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/56988544.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57009018.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57029035.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>Dealers are to confirm vehicle eligibility prior to beginning repairs by using the Investigate Vehicle History link. Not all vehicles within the above breakpoints may be involved.</b><br><br>For dealers with involved vehicles, a listing with involved vehicles containing the complete vehicle identification number, customer name, and address information has been prepared and will be provided to dealers/retailers through the GM GlobalConnect Recall Reports. Dealers will not have a report available if they have no involved vehicles currently assigned. <br><br>The listing may contain customer names and addresses obtained from Motor Vehicle Registration Records. The use of such motor vehicle registration data for any purpose other than follow-up necessary to complete this program is a violation of law in several states/provinces/countries. Accordingly, you are urged to limit the use of this report to the follow-up necessary to complete this program. <br><br><b>Parts Information</b><br><br><b>US: </b> OnStar(R) modules required for this program are to be obtained by contacting Autocraft Electronics via the web at www.autocraft.com, and selecting the catalog item that contains bulletin number 10037 (or PIC 4893B), or by calling 1-800-336-3998.

The availability of courtesy transportation to customers whose vehicles are within the warranty coverage period and involved in a product program is very important in maintaining customer satisfaction. Dealers are to ensure that these customers understand that shuttle service or some other form of courtesy transportation is available and will be provided at no charge. Dealers should refer to the General Motors Service Policies and Procedures Manual for Courtesy Transportation guidelines. <br><br><b>Warranty Transaction Information</b><br><br>Submit a claim using the table below. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57032236.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Submit 0.2 hours administrative allowance under "Administration Time" for the module exchange. <br><br>** The $25 represents the additional net amount allowed for the module exchange. <br><br>*** Dealers are to claim only administrative allowance of 0.2 hours when the module is replaced by York Electronic's Mobile Unit. Dealer should submit the 0.2 hours administrative allowance under Administrative Time. <br><br><b>Customer Notification</b><br><br>OnStar will notify customers of this program on their vehicle. <br><br><b>Dealer Program Responsibility</b><br><br>All unsold new vehicles in dealers' possession and subject to this program must be held and inspected/repaired per the service procedure of this program bulletin before customers take possession of these vehicles. <br><br>Dealers are to service all vehicles subject to this program at no charge to customers, regardless of mileage, age of vehicle, or ownership, through April 30, 2012. <br><br>Customers who have recently purchased vehicles sold from your vehicle inventory, and for which there is no customer information indicated on the dealer listing, are to be contacted by the dealer. Arrangements are to be made to make the required correction according to the instructions contained in this bulletin. <br><br>In summary, whenever a vehicle subject to this program enters your vehicle inventory, or is in your dealership for service through April 30, 2012, you must take the steps necessary to be sure the program correction has been made before selling or releasing the vehicle.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer <br><br></div>
