<h1>Cooling System Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b><a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">Cooling System</a> Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Description and Operation</b><br><br>For cooling fan description and operation, refer to Cooling Fan Description and Operation  (<a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/Description%20and%20Operation/">Description and Operation</a>) .<br><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Control - Two Fan System</b><br><br>The engine cooling fan system consists of 2 puller type electrical cooling fans and 3 fan relays. The relays are arranged in a series/parallel configuration that allows the engine control module (ECM) to operate both fans together at low or high speeds. The cooling fans and the fan relays receive battery positive voltage from the underhood fuse block. The ground path is provided at G104.<br><br><br>During low speed operation, the ECM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the low speed fan relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and supplies battery positive voltage from the low fan fuse through the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit to the left cooling fan. The ground path for the left cooling fan is through the cooling fan s/p relay and the right cooling fan. The result is a series circuit with both fans running at low speed.<br><br><br>During high speed operation the ECM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. After a 3-second delay, the ECM supplies a ground path for the high speed fan relay and the cooling fan s/p relay through the high speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the cooling fan s/p relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and provides a ground path for the left cooling fan. At the same time the high speed fan relay coil is energized closing the relay contacts and provides battery positive voltage from the high fan fuse on the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit to the right cooling fan. During high speed fan operation, both engine cooling fans have there own ground path. The result is a parallel circuit with both fans running at high speed.<br><br><br>The ECM commands the low speed cooling fans ON under the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature exceeds approximately 94.5&deg;C (202&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C refrigerant pressure exceeds 1447 kPa (210 psi).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the vehicle is shut OFF if the engine coolant temperature at key-off is greater than 101&deg;C (214&deg;F) the low speed fans will run for a minimum of 60 seconds After 60 seconds, if the coolant temperature drops below 101&deg;C (214&deg;F) the fans will shut OFF. The fans will automatically shut OFF after 3 minutes regardless of coolant temperature.<br><br><br>The ECM commands the high speed fans ON under the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature exceeds 104&deg;C (220&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C refrigerant pressure exceeds 1824 kPa (265 psi).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When certain DTCs set.<br><br><br>At idle and very low vehicle speeds the cooling fans are only allowed to increase in speed if required. This insures idle stability by preventing the fans from cycling between high and low speed.<br><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Control - Heavy Duty Cooling</b><br><br>The engine cooling fan system consists of 2 electrical pusher, 2 electrical puller type cooling fans and 3 fan relays. The low speed, high speed, and S/P relays are arranged in a series/parallel configuration that allows the ECM to operate the left cooling fan and right cooling fan together at low or high speeds. The cooling fans and fan relays receive battery positive voltage from the underhood fuse block. The ground path is provided at G104.<br><br><br>During low speed operation, the ECM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit.

The fans will automatically shut OFF after 4 minutes regardless of the coolant temperature.<br><br><br>The ECM commands the high speed fans ON under the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature exceeds 104&deg;C (220&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C refrigerant pressure exceeds 1824 kPa (265 psi).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When certain DTCs set.<br><br><br>At idle and very low vehicle speeds the cooling fans are only allowed to increase in speed if required. This ensures idle stability by preventing the fans from cycling between high and low speed.<br><br><br><b>Engine Coolant</b><br><br>Engine coolant is the key element of the heating system. The engine thermostat controls the normal engine operating coolant temperature. Coolant pumped out of the engine block enters the <a href="3671.html">heater core</a> through the inlet <a>heater hose</a>. The air flowing through the HVAC module absorbs the heat of the coolant flowing through the heater core. The coolant then exits the heater core through the heater outlet hose. To prevent the coolant from boiling after the engine is turned off an after-boil/heater coolant pump is used. <br><br><br>The HVAC control module will command the after-boil/heater coolant pump on when the engine is off under the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine coolant temperature is greater than 101&deg;C (214&deg;F).<br><br><br>The above coolant flow circuits are designed to show the coolant flow related to the coolant by-pass valve positions only. The thermostat function and thermostat coolant flow paths are not shown.<br><br><br><b>Coolant Warning Messages</b><br><br>The radio will display the following messages if the following conditions exist in the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine hot-A/C OFF, is displayed if the coolant temperature is greater than 117&deg;C (243&deg;F) for domestic vehicles or 115&deg;C (239&deg;F) for imports.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant hot-idle engine, is displayed if the coolant temperature is greater than 118&deg;C (245&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine overheated-stop engine, is displayed if the coolant temperature is greater than 123&deg;C (253&deg;F).<br><br><br><br><b>Coolant Level Control</b><br><br>The engine <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a> contains an engine coolant level switch to alert the driver in the event of a low coolant level. When the engine coolant level in the surge tank falls below a certain level, the coolant level switch opens. When the HVAC control module detects an open, or a high voltage level, on the coolant level indicator control circuit for at least 10 seconds, the control module sends a class 2 message to the radio requesting display of the low coolant level message. A 10-second delay occurs before the HVAC control module sends the class 2 message, to prevent the message from being displayed due to coolant sloshing in the surge tank.<br><br><br><b>Coolant Heater</b><br><br>The optional engine coolant heater (RPO K05) operates using 110-volt AC external power and is designed to warm the coolant in the engine block area for improved starting in very cold weather 29&deg;C (20&deg;F). The coolant heater helps reduce fuel consumption when a cold engine is warming up. The unit is equipped with a detachable AC power cord. A weather shield on the cord is provided to protect the plug when not in use.<br><br><br><b><a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">Cooling System</a></b><br><br>The <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>'s function is to maintain an efficient engine operating temperature during all engine speeds and operating conditions. The cooling system is designed to remove approximately one-third of the heat produced by the burning of the air-fuel mixture. When the engine is cold, the system cools slowly or not at all. This allows the engine to warm quickly. <br><br><b>Cooling Cycle</b><br><br>The thermostat is located between the radiator outlet and the water pump inlet. At normal operating temperature, coolant is drawn from the radiator outlet and into the water pump inlet by the water pump. In cold conditions, the thermostat will bypass the radiator, and the pump will draw coolant directly from the engine outlet.<br><br>Coolant is then pumped through the water pump outlet and into the engine block. In the engine block, the coolant circulates through the water jackets surrounding the cylinders where it absorbs heat.<br><br><br>The coolant is then forced through the <a>cylinder head gasket</a> openings and into the cylinder heads. In the cylinder heads, the coolant flows through the water jackets surrounding the combustion chambers and valve seats, where it absorbs additional heat.<br><br><br>Coolant is also directed to the throttle body. There it circulates through passages in the casting. During initial warm-up, the coolant assists in warming the throttle body. During normal operating temperatures, the coolant assists in keeping the throttle body cool.<br><br><br>From the cylinder heads, the coolant is then forced to the engine outlet. Coolant leaves the engine through four different routes:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Through the engine outlet fitting to the radiator. This path is blocked at cold conditions by the thermostat at the engine inlet fitting. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Through the radiator bypass.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>To the <a href="3671.html">heater core</a> for passenger compartment heat and defrost.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Through the vent hose to the surge tank, providing continuous direction of the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>.<br><br><br>Operation of the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a> requires proper functioning of all cooling system components. The cooling system consists of the following components:<br><br><b>Coolant</b><br><br>The engine coolant is a solution made up of a 50-50 mixture of DEX-COOL and clean drinkable water. The coolant solution carries excess heat away from the engine to the radiator, where the heat is dissipated to the atmosphere.<br><br><b>Radiator</b><br><br>The radiator is a heat exchanger. It consists of a core and two tanks. The aluminum core is a crossflow tube and fin design. This is a brazed tube with convoluted louvered fin design. Separate tubes and fins are stacked together with a manifold at each end. The entire core assembly is then brazed forming a homogeneous unified structure. The fins allow for efficient heat transfer from the coolant to the atmosphere. The inlet and outlet tanks are molded with a high temperature, glass reinforced nylon plastic. The tank and gasket is supplied as an assembly with silicone gasket attached to the tank. The tanks are clamped to the core with clinch tabs. The tabs are part of the aluminum header at each end of the core. The radiator also has a drain cock which is located in the bottom of the passenger side tank. The drain cock includes the drain cock and drain cock seal.<br><br>The radiator removes heat from the coolant passing through it. The fins on the core absorb heat from the coolant passing through the tubes. As air passes between the fins, it absorbs heat and cools the coolant.<br><br><br>During vehicle use, the coolant heats and expands. The coolant that is displaced by this expansion flows into the surge tank. As the coolant circulates, air is allowed to exit. Coolant without bubbles absorbs heat much better than coolant with bubbles.<br><br><b>Pressure Cap </b><br><br>The pressure cap is a cap that seals and pressurizes the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>. It contains a blow off or pressure valve and a vacuum or atmospheric valve. The pressure valve is held against its seat by a spring and protects the radiator by relieving pressure if it exceeds 18 psi. The vacuum valve is held against its seat by a spring, which permits opening of the valve to relieve vacuum created in the cooling system as it cools off. The vacuum, if not relieved, could cause the <a href="316.html">radiator hoses</a> to collapse.<br><br>The pressure cap allows pressure in the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a> to build up. As the pressure builds, the boiling point of the coolant goes up as well. Therefore, the coolant can be safely run at a temperature higher than the boiling point of the coolant at atmospheric pressure. The hotter the coolant is, the faster the heat moves from the radiator to the cooler passing air. However, if the pressure exceeds the strength of the spring, the pressure valve rises so that the excess pressure can escape. When the engine cools down, the temperature of the coolant drops and a vacuum is created in the cooling system. This vacuum causes the vacuum valve to open, allowing outside air into the cooling system. This equalizes the pressure in the cooling system with atmospheric pressure, thus preventing the <a href="316.html">radiator hoses</a> from collapsing.<br><br><b>Surge Tank </b><br><br>The surge tank is a plastic tank with a pressure cap mounted to it. The tank is mounted at a point higher than all other coolant passages. The surge tank provides an air space in the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>. The air space allows the coolant to expand and contract. The surge tank also provides a coolant fill point and a central air bleed location.<br><br>During vehicle use, the coolant heats and expands. The coolant that is displaced by this expansion flows into the surge tank. As the coolant circulates, air is allowed to exit. This is an advantage to the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>. Coolant without bubbles absorbs heat much better than coolant with bubbles.<br><br><b>Air Baffles and Seals </b><br><br>The <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a> uses deflectors, air baffles and air seals to increase system cooling. Deflectors are installed under the vehicle to redirect airflow beneath the vehicle to flow through the radiator and increase cooling. Air baffles are also used to direct airflow into the radiator and increase cooling. Air seals prevent air from bypassing the radiator and A/C condenser. Air seals also prevent recirculation of the air for better hot weather cooling and A/C condenser performance.<br><br><br><b>Water Pump</b><br><br>The water pump is a centrifugal vane impeller type pump. The pump consists of a housing and an impeller. The impeller is a flat plate mounted on the pump shaft with a series of flat or curved blades or vanes. When the impeller rotates, the coolant between the vanes is thrown outward by centrifugal force. The impeller shaft is supported by one or more sealed bearings. The sealed bearings never need to be lubricated. Grease cannot leak out, dirt and water cannot get in as long as the seal is not damaged or worn.<br><br>The purpose of the water pump is to circulate coolant throughout the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>. The water pump is driven by the <a href="477.html">crankshaft</a> via the <a href="302.html">drive belt</a>. <br><br><b>Thermostat</b><br><br>The thermostat is a coolant flow control component. Its purpose is to regulate the operating temperature of the engine. It utilizes a temperature sensitive wax-pellet element. The element connects to a valve through a <a href="480.html">piston</a>. When the element is heated, it expands and exerts pressure against a rubber diaphragm. This pressure forces the valve to open. As the element is cooled, it contracts. This contraction allows a spring to push the valve closed.<br><br>When the coolant temperature is below the rated thermostat opening temperature, the thermostat valve remains closed. This prevents circulation of the coolant to the radiator and allows the engine to warm up quickly. After the coolant temperature reaches rated thermostat opening temperature, the thermostat valve will open. The coolant is then allowed to circulate through the thermostat to the radiator where the engine heat is dissipated to the atmosphere. The thermostat also provides a restriction in the <a href="0.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a>, even after it has opened. This restriction creates a pressure difference which prevents cavitation at the water pump and forces coolant to circulate through the engine block.<br><br><b>Engine Oil Heat Exchanger</b><br><br>The engine oil heat exchanger is mounted to the top of the engine block, under the <a href="513.html">intake manifold</a> flange. Oil is pumped through the oil cooler inlet pipe to the heat exchanger, back through the oil cooler outlet pipe, and then to the oil passages in the engine for lubrication. The exchanger provides the following 2 functions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant warms up faster than the engine oil. During cold operation, the coolant warms the oil and provides better flow during cold engine operation.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the engine reaches normal operating temperature, the engine oil temperature will exceed the engine coolant temperature. The coolant flowing through the engine oil cooler will absorb heat from the engine oil. Cooling the engine oil extends oil life and helps reduce internal engine wear.<br><br><br><br><b>Transmission Oil Cooler-Two Fan System</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  The transmission oil cooler system uses quick connect fittings throughout the system. Use a special tool to disconnect these quick connect fittings. Removing the transmission oil cooler lines without this tool will result in damage to the radiator, the transmission, and the transmission oil cooler caused by mixing the transmission oil and coolant or due to transmission oil loss.<br><br><br>The transmission oil cooler is a heat exchanger located in the bottom tank of the radiator. The transmission oil temperature is regulated by the temperature of the coolant leaving the radiator and passing over the heat exchanger. Lines from the transmission bring oil pumped at a high pressure to the cooler and back to the transmission.<br><br><br><b>Transmission Oil Cooler-Three Fan System</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  The transmission oil cooler system uses quick connect fittings throughout the system. Use a special tool to disconnect these quick connect fittings. Removing the transmission oil cooler lines without this tool will result in damage to the radiator, the transmission, and the transmission oil cooler caused by mixing the transmission oil and coolant or due to transmission oil loss.<br><br><br>There are 2 transmission oil coolers in a series in the heavy duty transmission oil cooler system. The initial transmission oil cooler is a heat exchanger located in the bottom tank of the radiator. The transmission oil temperature is partially regulated by the temperature of the coolant leaving the radiator and passing over the heat exchanger. Lines from the transmission bring oil pumped at a high pressure to the cooler. The oil out of the cooler is plumbed to an air-to-oil cooler in front of the A/C condenser. This cooler provides additional cooling for heavy duty trailering. The transmission oil is then directed back to the transmission.<br><br><br><b>Transmission Oil Cooler Lines</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  The transmission oil cooler system uses quick connect fittings throughout the system. Use a special tool to disconnect these quick connect fittings. Removing the transmission oil cooler lines without this tool will result in damage to the radiator, the transmission, and the transmission oil cooler caused by mixing the transmission oil and coolant or due to transmission oil loss.<br><br><br>The transmission oil cooler lines use quick connect fittings on the transmission oil cooler lines near the A/C compressor. The quick connect fittings must be removed using a special tool. The transmission oil cooler is an oil-to-air heat exchanger located between the A/C condenser and the radiator. The transmission oil temperature is regulated by the temperature of the air leaving the A/C condenser and passing over the heat exchanger. Lines from the transmission bring oil pumped at a high pressure to the cooler and back to the transmission. A thermal bypass valve is located external to the transmission where the transmission oil cooler lines connect to the transmission. This provides uninterrupted transmission oil flow for low ambient temperature conditions.<br><br><br><b>Power Steering Oil Cooler</b><br><br>Some vehicles are equipped with a power steering oil cooler located either between the radiator and condenser (Heavy Duty) or in front of the engine. This cooler transfers heat from the power steering system to the air passing through the condenser and radiator. The cooler uses constant tension clamps on the hose connections to the cooler.<br><br></div>
