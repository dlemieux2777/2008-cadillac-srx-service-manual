<h1>Video Entertainment System Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Video Entertainment System Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Navigation Radio DVD Playback</b><br><br>Your vehicle may have the optional rear video display system. The system includes a navigation radio, fold down video display screen located in the rear of the center console, 2 sets of wireless headphones, and a <a href="4291.html">remote control</a>.<br><br><br>Rear video display receives a video signal via the navigation radio <a href="4184.html">DVD player</a>. The uplevel entertainment system offers the rear seat passengers to have shared control of all of the vehicles audio sources AM, FM, Digital Radio (if equipped), weather, CD, TV (export), and DVD movies .<br><br><br><b>Audio/Video Jack</b><br><br>These jacks allow you to connect audio and video signals from an auxiliary device such as a camcorder, video game console or MP3 player to the rear seat entertainment system. The middle jack is for left audio, the right jack is for right audio and the left jack is used for video. The system requires standard RCA cables to connect your auxiliary device to the RCA jacks. The auxiliary audio and video circuits are connected to the navigation radio.<br><br><br><b>Video Display</b><br><br>The video display is located in the rear of the center console. Avoid directly touching the video display to prevent distortion of the screen. Lift up the display by the top or the sides into the full open position. Adjust the displays position as desired. Store the display in the closed position when not in use. The disc player and display will continue to operate when the display is in either the up or the down position. The video screen contains the infrared transmitters for the wireless headphones and the infrared receiver for the <a href="4291.html">remote control</a>. If the display is in the closed position, the infrared signals will not be available for the operation of the wireless headphones and the remote control.<br><br><br><b>Headphones</b><br><br>The rear seat entertainment system includes 2 sets of wireless headphones.<br><br><br>Each set of headphones has an ON/OFF control. An indicator light will illuminate on the headphones when they are ON. If the light does not illuminate, the batteries may need to be replaced. To turn the headphones OFF, activate the ON/OFF control. Each set of headphones has a volume knob. To adjust the volume, adjust this knob.<br><br><br>The headphones will automatically turn OFF if they lose the signal from the system after about 4 minutes in order to preserve their battery power. The signal may be lost if the system is turned OFF, or if the headphones are out of range of the signal transmitters that are located below the video display screen.<br><br><br><b>Audio Output</b><br><br>All of the vehicles audio sources AM, FM, XM (if equipped), weather, CD, TV (export), and DVD movies can be controlled independently through the rear seat entertainment system and heard independently through the wireless headphones. This allows the rear entertainment system audio output to the wireless headphones be different from the vehicle speaker output. When the wireless headphones are in use the rear speakers are muted by the rear entertainment system.<br><br></div>
