<h1>Tire Monitor System - TPM Sensor Information</h1>INFORMATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 08-03-16-003<br><br>Date: May 12, 2008<br><br>Subject: <br>Warranty Reduction - Transfer of Tire Pressure Monitoring (TPM) Sensors to Replacement Wheels and Allowable TPM Sensor Replacements<br><br>Models:<br>2000-2009 GM Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks (including Saturn)<br>2003-2009 HUMMER H2<br>2006-2009 HUMMER H3<br>2005-2009 Saab 9-7x<br><br>with On-Wheel TPM Sensors<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/81544021.png"></div><br><br><br><br>TPM Sensor / Wheel Warranty Reviews<br><br>During the last warranty review period it was noted that wheels being returned under the GM New Vehicle Warranty were being shipped back to General Motors with the TPM sensor still attached to the wheel. Return rates ran as high as 60% with the TPM sensors still attached. Operational TPM sensors should not be returned to GM and are to be transferred to replacement wheels if they become necessary.<br><br><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Operational TPM Sensors that are returned under warranty to General Motors will be charged back to the dealer.Sensors have a 10 year /150,000 mile (240,000 km) battery life, and should be transferred if one or more wheels are replaced.<br><br>TPM Valve Stem / Grommet (0-ring) Replacement<br><br>When the TPM sensors are transferred to new wheels you should replace the component used to seal the TPM sensor stem to the wheel. On sensors with an aluminum stem and visible nut on the outside of the wheel a replacement grommet (0-ring) should be used to assure a proper seal. The sensor retaining nut (except Aveo) should be tightened to 7 N.m (62 lb in) for all vehicles except Pontiac Vibe (4.0 N.m (35.4 lb in)).<br><br><b>Important:</b><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DO NOT overtorque the retaining nut.<br><br><b>Notice:</b><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Factory installed TPM Sensors come with plastic aluminum or nickel-plated brass stem caps. These caps should not be changed. Chrome plated steel caps may cause corrosion of aluminum valve stems due to incompatibility of the metals.<br><br>On current style sensors the entire rubber stem is replaceable. The service interval on the revised TPM sensor with replaceable stem is the same as for any other traditional valve stem. Replace the stem at the time of tire replacement sensor transfer or whenever air seepage is suspected at the valve stem. When replacing the valve stem tighten the screw to 1.3 N.m (11.5 lb in).<br><br>For either style of TPM sensor see the service parts guide for the correct GM part numbers to order and use.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
