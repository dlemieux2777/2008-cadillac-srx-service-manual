The switches consist of 2 positions, lock and unlock, and are in the normally open state. When placed in either the lock or unlock positions, the switches provide a direct input to there respective door control module. When a power door lock switch is operated to the lock or unlock position, the associated door control module responds by sending a GMLAN serial data message indicating a change in the switch's position. This serial data message is received by the opposite door control module as well as the body control module (BCM). The DDM and PDM respond to the lock/unlock request by activating there associated power door lock motors to the appropriate direction to lock or unlock the front doors. The <a href="34.html">BCM</a> is responsible for controlling the left and right rear passenger door lock motors. The BCM, upon receipt of a lock or unlock serial data signal, will control either the rear door lock or unlock relay. When the appropriate <a>door lock relay</a> is energized, the rear power door lock motors will lock or unlock the rear doors.<br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br>Door Lock/Indicator Schematics  (<a href="6647.html">Door Lock/Indicator Schematics</a>)<br><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br>Component Connector End Views  (<a href="0.html#Diagrams/Connector%20Views/">Connector Views</a>)<br><b>Description and Operation</b><br><br>Power Door Latch Description and Operation  (<a href="4658.html">Description and Operation</a>)<br><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><br><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br>Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) for scan tool information<br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, observe the scan tool Driver Door Open Sw. parameter located in the Driver Door Switch Data Display Inputs menu while opening and closing the driver door.
