Propeller shaft systems that have 1 U-joint have 1 working angle; systems with 2 U-joints have 2 working angles, and so on. In a typical 1-piece prop system with 2 U-joints, the working angles are front (1) and rear (2):<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The front working angle (1) is formed by the intersection of the transmission or transfer case output shaft and the prop shaft.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The rear working angle (2) is formed by the intersection of the prop shaft and the drive axle pinion.<br><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>When measuring and evaluating U-joint working angles, observe the following:</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No U-joint working angle should be equal to zero. An angle of 0 degrees will cause premature U-joint wear due to a lack of rotation of the needle bearings in the U-joint.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No U-joint working angle should exceed 4 degrees.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Prop systems containing only 1 U-joint: The U-joint working angle should be within the range specified in this procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Prop systems containing 2 or 3 U-joints: The 2 U-joint angles each formed with the prop shaft that contains 2 welded yokes are designed to cancel each other during operation. These 2 working, or cancelling U-joint angles should be equal to each other within the range specified in this procedure provide effective cancellation of the U-joints.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Prop systems containing 3 U-joints: The U-joint angle formed by the prop shaft that contains only 1 welded yoke is an odd, or non-cancelled angle. This working angle should be within the range specified in this procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always orientate the J 23498-A  so that it faces the same side of the vehicle for each measurement taken.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/757888985.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Be sure to accurately record the measurements taken on a diagram, similar to the one shown.<br><br><br><br><b>Measurement Procedure</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>If it is necessary to use the J 23498-20  , or equivalent adapter, first verify the accuracy of the J 23498-20  , or equivalent by inspecting the angle of an accessible joint using the J 23498-A  , or equivalent, then inspecting the same joint angle using the J 23498-20  , or equivalent.</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For vehicles with solid axles, ensure that the vehicle has a full tank of fuel or the equivalent amount of weight in the correct location to simulate a full tank. The weight of 3.8 L (1 gal) of gasoline is approximately 2.8 kg (6.2 lb).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise and support the vehicle. On vehicles with solid axles, ensure that the drive axle is supported at ride height-vehicle body supported by suspension components. Suspension travel will not affect driveline angles on vehicles with direct-mounted drive axles. Ensure the wheels are free to rotate. Refer to Lifting and Jacking the Vehicle  (<a href="7887.html">Service and Repair</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For vehicles with 2-piece prop shaft systems, inspect the lateral alignment of the propeller shafts before proceeding:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>From underneath the propeller shafts, look down the length of the shafts from front to rear. Inspect the alignment of the shafts to each other.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>From underneath the shafts, if the propeller shafts are not aligned to each other in a straight line, then the lateral alignment of the prop shafts needs to be adjusted before proceeding.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The propeller shaft support bearing assembly can be relocated slightly to one side in order to improve the alignment of the shafts. Ensure that you do not create a ground-out condition against the exhaust or any other component.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the transmission in NEUTRAL.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean any corrosion or foreign material from the U-joint bearing caps.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove any of the U-joint bearing cap snap rings that may interfere with the correct placement of the J 23498-A  , or equivalent .<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/757889692.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For all prop systems perform the first measurement:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Rotate the prop shaft to align the rear-most yoke flanges vertically.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Install the J 23498-A  , or equivalent to the lower U-joint bearing cap of the rear-most yoke.
