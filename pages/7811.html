<h1>Information Bus: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Data Link Communications Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Circuit Description</b><br><br>The communication among control modules is performed through the High speed GMLAN serial data circuits and the Low speed GMLAN serial data circuit. The modules that need real time communication are attached to the High speed GMLAN network. The body control module (BCM) is the gateway between the high and low speed networks. Communication is necessary between the high and low speed serial data modules for the vehicle to start. Refer to Body Control System Description and Operation  (<a href="4437.html">Description and Operation</a>) for more information about the gateway.<br><br><br>Signal supervision is the process of determining whether an expected signal is being received or not. Some messages are sent on a periodic basis and are interpreted as a heartbeat of a device. If such a signal is lost, the signal supervision part of the software will set a no communication DTC (U code) against the missing device. This code is mapped on the Tech 2 screen as a code against the physical device. A lost communication DTC typically is set in modules other than the module with a communication failure.<br><br><br><b>GMLAN High Speed Circuit Description</b><br><br>The data link connector (DLC) allows a scan tool to communicate with the high speed GMLAN serial data circuit. The serial data is transmitted on two twisted wires that allow speed up to 500 Kb/s. The twisted pair is terminated with two 120 ohms resistors, one is internal to the engine control module (ECM) and the other is external after the vehicle communication interface module (VCIM) or electronic suspension control module (ESCM) (if equipped). The high speed GMLAN is a differential bus. The high speed GMLAN serial data bus (+) and high speed GMLAN serial data (-) are driven to opposite extremes from a rest or idle level. The idle level, which is approximately 2.5 volts, is considered recessive transmitted data and is interpreted as a logic 1. Driving the lines to their extremes, adds one volt to the high speed GMLAN serial data bus (+) and subtracts one volt from the high speed GMLAN serial data bus (-) wire. <br><br><br><b>GMLAN Low Speed Circuit Description</b><br><br>The data link connector (DLC) allows a scan tool to communicate with the low speed GMLAN serial data circuit. The serial data is transmitted over a single wire to the appropriate control modules. Under normal vehicle operating conditions, the speed of the buss is 33.33 Kb/s. This protocol produces a simple pulse train sent out over the GMLAN low speed serial data bus. When a module pulls the buss high, 5 volts, this creates a logic state of 0 on the buss. When the buss is pulled low, 0 volts, it is translated as a logic state of 1. To wake the control modules connected to the GMLAN low speed serial data buss, a high voltage wake up pulse is sent out over the buss, the voltage level of the pulse is +10 volts. Modules connected to the GMLAN low speed buss can be part of a virtual network as described in GMLAN High Speed Circuit Description above. The modules on the GMLAN low speed serial data buss are connected to the buss using SP 205 as the common connection sometimes called a star connector. Refer to Data Communication Schematics  (<a href="7810.html">Electrical Diagrams</a>) for specific schematics information.<br><br><br><b>Data Link Connector (DLC)</b><br><br>The data link connector (DLC) is a standardized 16-cavity connector. Connector design and location is dictated by an industry wide standard, and is required to provide the following:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pin 1 GMLAN low speed communications terminal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pin 4 Scan tool power ground terminal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pin 5 Common signal ground terminal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pin 6 High speed GMLAN serial data bus (+) terminal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pin 14 High speed GMLAN serial data bus (-) terminal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pin 16 Scan tool power, battery positive voltage terminal<br><br><br><br><b>Serial Data Reference</b><br><br>The scan tool communicates over the various busses on the vehicle. In order to avert misdiagnoses of No Communication with a specific module and to determine if a module is low or high speed, refer to Data Link References  (<a href="7812.html">Data Link References</a>) for a list of modules, the busses they communicate with, and the RPO codes for a specific module.<br><br></div>
