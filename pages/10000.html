<h1>Engine - Air Cleaner Cover Installation Precaution</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>08-06-01-020A<br><br><b>Date: </b>October 04, 2010<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Information to Prevent Incorrect Installation of Air Cleaner Cover to <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Air%20Cleaner%20Housing/">Air Cleaner Housing</a><br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2004-2007 Cadillac CTS (Excluding V Series) <br>2004-2009 Cadillac SRX <br>2004-2011 Cadillac STS (Except V Series) <br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to clarify the Subject text and update the model year information. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 08-06-01-020 (Section 06 - Engine/Propulsion System).<br><br>The air cleaner (outlet side) may be difficult to reinstall in the proper position if it has been fully removed from the housing. The tabs on the cover must be correctly aligned with the hinge slots in the (inlet side) housing. It is possible to incorrectly reassemble the cover to the housing without the cover being seated properly at the hinge. This condition may not be visible when viewing the box from the top.<br><br><b>Caution</b><br>A continued supply of unfiltered air to the engine may result in accelerated wear to some internal components. <br><br>To reduce the risk of an improperly sealed airbox, verify that the cover is seated correctly in the housing before reinstalling the cover bolts. The following illustrations represent the proper and improper installation of the tabs.<br><b>Incorrect Installation of Airbox Cover</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/125877403.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Tabs<br><br>Hinge Slots<br><br>To inspect that the cover is properly seated once the cover bolts have been tightened, gently pull up on the cover/MAF sensor adapter. This will give a positive indication that the tabs of the cover are properly seated in the hinge slots.<br><br><b>Correct Installation of Airbox Cover</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/125916654.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Tabs<br><br>Hinge Slots<br><br><b>Tip</b><br>If just replacing the filter element, the (outlet side) cover does not need to be completely removed from the housing.
