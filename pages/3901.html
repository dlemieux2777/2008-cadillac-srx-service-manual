This is because the back of a rear-facing child restraint would be very close to the inflating air bag. NEVER use a rear-facing child restraint in this vehicle. If a forward-facing child restraint is suitable for your child, ALWAYS move the front passenger seat as far back as it will go and then install the child restraint. Be sure the child restraint position does not conflict with any additional requirements provided by the manufacturer. For more information, refer to the vehicle owners manual and the instruction that came with the child restraint.<br><br><br>The child seat may only be used in a forward facing seating location. The child seat should be installed and secured according to the manufacturer's directions. If the child seat has a top strap, the seat will need to be anchored. Passengers should not be allowed to sit at locations where the <a href="3893.html">seat belts</a> are being used to secure the child seat.<br><br><br>All vehicles are equipped with a dual-mode type retractor with emergency and automatic locking features. The automatic locking feature is for restraint of a child seat. The child seat can be secured by pulling the <a href="3893.html">seat belt</a> all the way out to lock it. Then, tighten the seat belt around the child seat.<br><br><br>If a child seat is to be used in the second seat position, a special dealer-installed anchor must be used in order to anchor the child seat top strap. (This only applies to the seats designed with the top strap provision and for the vehicles sold in Canada). In order to ensure the correct top strap angle, the child seat is only to be used at the seating position for which the top strap anchor is installed.<br><br><br>The inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) receives a discrete input from the left front seat belt switch. The left front seat belt switch is closed when the <a href="3893.html">seat belt</a> is unbuckled.<br><br><br><b>Fasten Safety Belt Indicator (ISO Symbol) (Red)</b><br><br>The fasten safety belt indicator may only be ON during RUN. The instrument panel cluster (IPC) illuminates the fasten safety belt indicator under the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>During the bulb check.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) sends the status of the driver's seat belt switch to the IPC via a class 2 message. If the <a href="3893.html">seat belt</a> is unfastened, the IPC will illuminate the fasten safety belt indicator for 72 seconds or until the seat belt is fastened. If the seat belt is unfastened within 8 seconds following the bulb check, the IPC sends a class 2 serial message requesting 5 chimes to sound.<br><br><br></div>
