<h1>Pedal Positioning System: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Adjustable Pedals Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Adjustable Pedals System Components</b><br><br>The adjustable pedals system consists of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The adjustable pedals position switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The memory seat module<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The adjustable pedals motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The accelerator pedal position sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The brake pedal position sensor<br><br><br><br><b>Adjustable Pedals System Operation</b><br><br>The adjustable pedal system is controlled by the memory seat module (MSM) and operation can occur only while the transmission selector lever is in the park position. The adjustable pedals are moved forward or backward by a motor which is fastened to the brake pedal assembly with drive cables to the brake and accelerator pedal actuators.<br><br><br>The adjuster motor is controlled by the MSM through two motor control circuits. In an inactive state both control circuits are closed to ground within the module. The MSM drives the adjuster motor in the forward or rearward direction by closing the appropriate control circuit to battery voltage. The adjuster motor is bidirectional and the direction of the pedal assembly travel is determined by which of the motor control circuits is switched to battery voltage while the other remains grounded.<br><br><br>The adjustable pedals forward and rearward switches are inputs to the module. Battery voltage is supplied to the switch from the MSM. When the switch is operated to the forward or rearward direction the forward or rearward switch signal circuit is closed to the battery voltage circuit. Battery voltage on a switch signal circuit indicates to the MSM that the switch is active.<br><br><br>The MSM monitors the locations of the adjustable pedals using position sensors mounted to the brake and accelerator pedal actuators. The position sensors are supplied with a 5-volt reference and ground circuits from the MSM. The position sensor signal circuits are referenced from ground within the module. The signal voltages range from 0.22-4.75 volts and are determined by the wiper locations on the resistors within the position sensors. The position sensor signal circuit voltage levels are used by the MSM to determine the positions of the adjustable pedals when storing or recalling memory position settings. The MSM also monitors the locations of both pedal assemblies in order to prevent a step over condition from occurring. During manual or memory operation the position sensor inputs to the MSM must remain within 0.6 volts or 31 counts of each other. If at any time the difference between position sensor inputs exceeds the allowable limit, the MSM will disable adjustable operation until the fault has been corrected. Anytime adjustable pedal system components are replaced, including the MSM, the system will not operate until the calibration procedure has be performed. Refer to Adjustable Pedal System Calibration  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) . During a calibration procedure the position sensor inputs must not vary more than 0.3 volts or 23 counts.<br><br></div>
