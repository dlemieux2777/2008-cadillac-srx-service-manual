<h1>Troubleshooting with a Digital Multimeter</h1><br><br><b>Troubleshooting with a Digital Multimeter</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Refer to Test Probe Notice  .<br><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Circuits which include any solid state control modules, such as the powertrain control module (PCM), should only be tested with a 10 megohm or higher impedance digital multimeter such as the J 39200  Digital Multimeter (DMM). </b><br><br><br><br>The J 39200  instruction manual is a good source of information and should be read thoroughly upon receipt of the DMM as well as kept on hand for future reference.<br><br><br>A DMM should be used instead of a test lamp in order to test for voltage in high impedance circuits. While a test lamp shows whether voltage is present if the impedance is low enough, a DMM indicates how much voltage is present. In other words, if there is not enough current, the test lamp will not illuminage even though voltage is present.<br><br><br>The ohmmeter function on a DMM shows how much resistance exists between 2 points along a circuit. Low resistance in a circuit means good continuity. <br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Disconnect the power feed from the suspect circuit when measuring resistance with a DMM. This prevents incorrect readings. DMMs apply such a small voltage to measure resistance that the presence of voltages can upset a resistance reading.</b><br><br><br><br>Diodes and solid state components in a circuit can cause a DMM to display a false reading. To find out if a component is affecting a measurement take a reading once, then reverse the leads and take a second reading. If the readings differ the solid state component is affecting the measurement.<br><br><br>Following are examples of the various methods of connecting the DMM to the circuit to be tested:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Backprobe both ends of the connector and either hold the leads in place while manipulating the connector or tape the leads to the harness for continuous monitoring while you perform other operations or test driving. Refer to Probing Electrical Connectors  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Disconnect the harness at both ends of the suspected circuit where it connects either to a component or to other harnesses.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the system that is being diagnosed has a specified pinout or breakout box, it may be used in order to simplify connecting the DMM to the circuit or for testing multiple circuits quickly.<br><br><br></div>
