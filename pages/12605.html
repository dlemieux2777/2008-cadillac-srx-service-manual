Water may collect near a single <a href="1206.html">fuel injector</a> at the lowest point in the fuel injection system and cause a misfire in that cylinder. If the fuel system is contaminated with water, inspect the fuel system components for rust or deterioration.<br><br><br>Ethanol concentrations of greater than 10 percent can cause driveability conditions and fuel system deterioration. Fuel with more than 10 percent ethanol could result in driveability conditions such as hesitation, lack of power, stalling, or no start. Excessive concentrations of ethanol used in vehicles not designed for it may cause fuel system corrosion, deterioration of rubber components, and <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Filter/">fuel filter</a> restriction.<br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><b>Special Tools Required</b><br><br>J 44175 Fuel Composition Tester<br><br><br><b>System Verification</b><br><br>The fuel sample should be drawn from the bottom of the tank so that any water present in the tank will be detected.

If alcohol is present in the fuel, the volume of the lower layer, which would now contain both alcohol and water, will be more than 10 ml (0.34 oz). For example, if the volume of the lower layer is increased to 15 ml (0.51 oz), this indicates at least 5 percent alcohol in the fuel. The actual amount of alcohol may be somewhat more because this procedure does not extract all of the alcohol from the fuel.<br><br><br><br><b>Particulate Contaminants in Fuel Testing Procedure</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using an approved fuel container, draw approximately 0.5 liter (0.53 qt) of fuel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the container on a level surface for approximately 5 minutes in order to allow settling of the particulate contamination. Particulate contamination will show up in various shapes and colors. Sand will typically be identified by a white or light brown crystals. Rubber will appear as black and irregular particles.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Observe the fuel sample.
