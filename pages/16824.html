<h1>Body - Bumps or Rust Colored Spots in Paint</h1><b>TECHNICAL</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>05-08-51-008C<br><br><b>Date: </b>June 22, 2009<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Bumps or Rust Colored Spots in <a href="4827.html">Paint</a> Due to Rail or Iron Dust (Remove Rail Dust)<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>1994-2010 GM Passenger Cars and Trucks (Including Saturn)<br>2003-2010 HUMMER H2<br>2006-2010 HUMMER H3<br>2005-2009 Saab 9-7X<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 05-08-51-008B (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br><b>Condition</b><br><br>Visible rust colored spots or bumps on a vehicle's <a href="4827.html">paint</a> surface from rail or iron dust.<br><br><b>Cause</b><br><br>Rail dust comes from tiny iron particles produced from the friction between train wheels and the tracks and gets deposited on the vehicle surfaces. Iron dust can get deposited on the surface if the vehicle is stored near any operation producing iron dust such as an iron ore yard. Either material can lay on top of, or become embedded in, the <a href="4827.html">paint</a> surface.<br><br><b>Correction</b><br><br>Because the severity of the condition varies, proper diagnosis of the damage is critical to the success of repairs. Diagnosis should be performed on horizontal surfaces (<a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Doors%2C%20Hood%20and%20Trunk/Hood/">hood</a>, roof, deck lid, pick up box, etc.) after the vehicle has been properly cleaned. There are two types of repair materials recommended to repair rail dust or iron dust:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>GEL TYPE OXALIC ACID:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>- Has the characteristics of the liquid type oxalic acid but stays where you put it because of its gel consistency.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>CLAY TYPE NON-ACID BASED:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>- Requires surface lubricant during use.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>- Has different grades available.<br><br><b>Caution</b><br>Rail dust remover (Oxalic Acid) is an acidic substance containing chemicals that will break down the iron particles embedded in the finish. When working with rail dust remover, use the necessary safety equipment, including gloves and goggles. Follow the chemical manufacturer's directions closely because it may require special handling and disposal.<br><br>If, upon inspection, some particles are still present, the various chemical manufacturer's processes can be repeated.<br><br>After the removal process, small pits may remain in the clearcoat and can be corrected, in most cases, with a finesse/polish operation. <br><br><b>Procedure</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Move the vehicle to a cool shaded area and make sure that the vehicle surfaces are cool during the removal process.
