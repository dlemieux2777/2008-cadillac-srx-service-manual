The ignition voltage is supplied directly to the fuel injectors. The control module controls each fuel injector by grounding the control circuit via a solid state device called a driver. A fuel injector coil winding resistance that is too high or too low will affect the engine driveability. A fuel injector control circuit DTC may not set, but a misfire may be apparent. The fuel injector coil windings are affected by temperature. The resistance of the fuel injector coil windings will increase as the temperature of the fuel injector increases.<br><br><br>When performing the <a href="1206.html">fuel injector</a> balance test, the scan tool is first used to energize the <a href="38.html">fuel pump relay</a>. The fuel injector tester or the scan tool is then used to pulse each injector for a precise amount of time, allowing a measured amount of the fuel to be injected. This causes a drop in the system <a href="959.html">fuel pressure</a> that can be recorded and used to compare each injector.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Monitoring the misfire current counters, or misfire graph, may help to isolate the <a href="1206.html">fuel injector</a> that is causing the condition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Operating the vehicle over a wide temperature range may help isolate the <a href="1206.html">fuel injector</a> that is causing the condition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Perform the <a href="1206.html">fuel injector</a> coil test within the conditions of the customer's concern.
