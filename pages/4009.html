<h1>Keyless Entry: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Keyless Entry System Description and Operation</b><br><br>The keyless entry system is a vehicle entry device. The keyless entry system is used in conjunction with the body control module (BCM) to remotely activate certain vehicle features. <a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">Keyless entry</a> will lock/unlock the doors/liftgate, operate the power liftgate (if equipped), or release the liftglass when a corresponding button on the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> is pressed. This is accomplished by the transmitter sending a radio frequency to the <a href="4291.html">remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR). The RCDLR interprets the signal and activates the requested function via a serial data message to the BCM. A low transmitter or vehicle battery or radio frequency (RF) interference from aftermarket devices, such as 2-way radios, power inverters, computers, etc., may cause a system malfunction. High RF traffic areas may also cause interference that could lead to a malfunction. Keyless entry allows you to operate the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Door locks<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Liftgate lock<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Power liftgate, if equipped<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Liftglass, if equipped<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remote vehicle starting, if equipped<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Illuminated entry lamps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle locator/Panic alarm<br><br><br>The keyless entry system has the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="4648.html">Keyless entry transmitters</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">Keyless entry</a> antenna<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>BCM<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>RCDLR<br><br><br><br><b><a href="4648.html">Keyless Entry Transmitters</a></b><br><br>The <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitters</a> are used to lock and unlock the vehicle door while away from the immediate are of the vehicle. Vehicles without remote vehicle start will operate at a distance of up to 20 m (65 ft) away, except for Japanese and South Korean vehicles, which are limited to 4 m (16 feet). Vehicles with remote vehicle start will operate at a distance of up to 60 m (195 ft) away. Up to 8 transmitters may be programmed to a single vehicle.<br><br><br><b><a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">Keyless Entry</a> Antenna</b><br><br>The <a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">keyless entry</a> antenna is used to receive radio frequency (RF) communications sent by the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitters</a>.

It also allows the vehicle HVAC system and other vehicle systems to enable, providing a comfortable vehicle upon entry. RVS functions have an operating range of up to 195 feet, depending on conditions. The RVS sequence begins by pressing and releasing the lock button and then pressing and holding the RVS buttons on the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a>. The turn signal lamps will illuminate to indicate the vehicle has received the remote start request. Each time an RVS is performed, the vehicle doors are locked, however they may then be unlocked/locked with the transmitter or vehicle key at any time. Once activated, the engine is allowed to run for 10 minutes. The RVS time may be extended by an additional 10 minutes by again pressing and releasing the lock button and then pressing and holding the RVS buttons on the transmitter. This feature is called a RVS continue and allows a maximum of 20 minutes of engine running. If the RVS continue is performed at 7 minutes into the initial 10 minute time-out, a total of 17 minutes of engine running would occur. The RVS event may be suspended at any time by pressing only the RVS button on the transmitter or by entering the vehicle and turning ON the hazard lamps.<br><br><br>In between ignition cycles, only 2 RVS events may occur or be attempted. Once 2 events or attempts have been made, future RVS events will be suspended until the vehicle is started using the ignition.<br><br><br><b>Enable/Disable RVS</b><br><br>Using the driver information center (DIC), RVS may be enabled or disabled as a part of vehicle personalization. Refer to the vehicle owners manual for more information.<br><br><br><b>Hood Ajar Switch</b><br><br>The hood switch provides status of the hood to the BCM for RVS purposes. The switch is integrated into the hood latch assembly. The hood ajar switch provides 2 separate inputs to the BCM. These separate inputs allow the BCM to actively monitor for a hood ajar switch fault. <br><br><br><b>RVS Circuit Description</b><br><br>The RCDLR receives a signal from the <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitter</a> indicating a RVS request. A message is then sent to the BCM which determines if a crank request message will be sent to the ECM to allow engine starting. To determine if conditions are correct for an RVS event, the BCM will ensure the following conditions are met:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>All vehicle doors are closed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A valid hood ajar switch closed signal is present.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The doors are locked.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The hazard switch is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle power mode is correct.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No content theft deterrent (CTD) alarm triggers are present.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is not in valet mode, if equipped.<br><br><br>When the BCM determines all conditions meet those required for an RVS event, a message is sent via serial data to the ECM. The ECM relies on the RVS message from BCM to enable RVS when the crank request signal is received. If the ECM does not receive a valid RVS message, it will not attempt to start the engine. While the ECM is in RVS mode it will suspend engine operation if any of the following additional conditions occur:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle speed is greater than 0.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission is not in PARK.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Excessive engine coolant temperature<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Low oil pressure<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) is commanded ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine crank time is greater than 30 seconds.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Excessive engine speed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Accelerator pedal position too high<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remote start timer equals 0.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Immobilizer system indicates tamper<br><br><br><br><b><a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">Keyless Entry</a> Personalization</b><br><br>Vehicle lock/unlock functions and remote vehicle start (RVS) settings may be personalized. For functional descriptions and personalization instructions, refer to the vehicle owners manual.<br><br><br><b>Rolling Code</b><br><br>The Keyless Entry System uses rolling code technology. Rolling code technology prevents anyone from recording the message sent from the transmitter and using the message in order to gain entry to the vehicle. The term "rolling code" refers to the way that the Keyless Entry System sends and receives the signals. The transmitter sends the signal in a different order each time. The transmitter and the <a href="4291.html">remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR) are synchronized to the appropriate order. If a programmed transmitter sends a signal that is not in the order that the RCDLR expects, then the transmitter is out of synchronization. This occurs after 256 presses of any transmitter button when it is out of range of the vehicle.<br><br><br><b>Automatic Synchronization</b><br><br>The <a href="4648.html">keyless entry transmitters</a> do not require a manual synchronization procedure. If needed, the transmitters automatically re-synchronize when any button on the transmitter is pressed within range of the vehicle. The transmitter will operate normally after the automatic synchronization.<br><br></div>
