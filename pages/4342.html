Satellites orbiting earth are constantly transmitting signals of their current location, from which the OnStar(R) system is able to pinpoint its own location. The navigation antenna housed in the quad band radio antenna receives these GPS signals and provides the data to the VCIM to be processed. The navigation antenna is connected to the vehicle communication interface module (VCIM) via a shielded coaxial cable. The <a href="3995.html">antenna cable</a> also provides a path for DC current for powering the antenna.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The GPS signal title on the scan tool will display a Yes or No dependant upon whether or not the module sees an increment of the seconds transmitted by GPS signals to the vehicle communication interface module. Upon entering this screen, the GPS signal title will automatically display Yes, regardless of the presence of time increment, for at least 2 seconds, while the algorithm in the scan tool determines the status of the clock. If increment is found, Yes is continually displayed. If the clock remains static, No is displayed. The scan tool looks for increment every second, regardless of current display. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inaccurate or aged GPS position concerns which are no longer present may have been due to the temporary loss of GPS signal reception by the vehicle. Conditions such as driving through tunnels or parking structures while making an OnStar(R) keypress will restrict the navigation antenna from a clear view of the satellites in the sky and may have caused this temporary data loss. <br><br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br>OnStar Schematics  (<a href="6610.html">OnStar Schematics</a>)<br><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br>Component Connector End Views  (<a href="0.html#Diagrams/Connector%20Views/">Connector Views</a>)<br><b>Description and Operation</b><br><br>OnStar Description and Operation  (<a href="4322.html">OnStar Description and Operation</a>)<br><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>OnStar Description and Operation  (<a href="4322.html">OnStar Description and Operation</a>)<br><br><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br>Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>)for scan tool information<br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>It is important to have the vehicle in an open outside area where a cellular call can be successfully placed and GPS data can be received from the satellites.
