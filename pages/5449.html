The brake pedal position sensor provides an analog voltage signal that will increase as the brake pedal is applied. The body control module (BCM) provides a low reference signal and a 5-volt reference voltage to the brake pedal position sensor. When the variable signal reaches a voltage threshold indicating the brakes have been applied, the BCM will apply battery voltage to the right and left stop lamp control circuits, transmission control module (TCM), engine control module (ECM), and center high mounted stop lamp (CHMSL) control circuit.<br><br><b>European</b><br><br>The brake pedal position sensor is used to sense the action of the driver application of the brake pedal. The brake pedal position sensor provides an analog voltage signal that will increase as the brake pedal is applied. The body control module (BCM) provides a low reference signal and a 5-volt reference voltage to the brake pedal position sensor. When the variable signal reaches a voltage threshold indicating the brakes have been applied, the BCM will apply battery voltage to stop lamp relay coil side control circuit, transmission control module (TCM), engine control module (ECM), and center high mounted stop lamp (CHMSL). When the stop lamp relay receives battery voltage from the BCM, the relay coil is energized and the stop lamp relay switch contacts close applying battery voltage from the STOP LAMPS fuse to illuminate the rear stop lamps and trailer stop lamps.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br>The stop lamps will not illuminate unless the ignition is in the ON position.
