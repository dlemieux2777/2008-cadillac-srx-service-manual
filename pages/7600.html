The relay switch is held in the open position by spring tension. Battery positive voltage is supplied directly to the relay coil and the relay switch contact at all times. The engine control module (ECM) supplies the ground path to the relay coil control circuit through an output driver module (ODM). The ODM for the powertrain relay also incorporates a fault detection circuit, which is continuously monitored by the ECM. When the ECM commands the powertrain relay ON, ignition 1 voltage is supplied to fuses in the underhood fuse block.<br><br><br>The ignition 1 voltage that is supplied to the ECM, provides power to the internal ECM circuits associated with the throttle actuator control (TAC) operation. The ECM also monitors the voltage level on the ignition 1 voltage circuit to confirm that the powertrain relay contacts have closed.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><br><b>P0685</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The battery voltage is between 9-18 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The powertrain relay has been commanded ON.<br><br><br><br><b>P0690</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The battery voltage is between 9-16 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The powertrain relay has been commanded OFF.<br><br><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><br><b>P0685</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The commanded state of the ODM does not match and the actual state of the control circuit.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The condition is present for more than 5 seconds.<br><br><br><br><b>P0690</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects more than 2 volts on the ignition 1 voltage circuit to the ECM.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The condition is present for more than 2 seconds.<br><br><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br>DTCs P0685 and P0690 are Type A DTCs.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Clearing the DTC</b><br><br>DTCs P0685 and P0690 are Type A DTCs.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This test procedure assumes that the vehicle battery has passed a load test and is completely charged.
