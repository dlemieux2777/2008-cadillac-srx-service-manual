<h1>Collision Avoidance and Parking Assist Systems: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Object Detection Description and Operation (Rear Park Assist)</b><br><br><b>Object Alarm System Description</b><br><br>The object <a href="3.html">alarm module</a> monitors the distance and how close a vehicle is to an object when backing up in a parking maneuver. The object alarm module will notify the driver of any objects of interest when backing up at speeds less than 8 km/h (5 mph). The distance between a vehicle and an object of interest is monitored by 4 ultrasonic sensors located in the rear bumper of the vehicle. The object alarm sensors receive the echo signal reflected off an object of interest while the vehicle is backing up at speeds less than 8 km/h (5 mph). The object alarm module receives the vehicle speed from the ECM via the serial data circuit. When the backing up speed exceeds 8 km/h (5 mph), the object alarm system is disabled. The object alarm system uses visual displays and audible warnings from the radio speakers to warn the driver of an object of interest within the defined field of view. The BCM controls the object alarm system chime function and sends serial data requests to the radio to sound the chime as needed. The visual display comprises of two amber and one red indicator and these indicators illuminate based on the vehicle distance to the object of interest. When the ignition is ON and the vehicle is placed into REVERSE, the object detection system performs a bulb check on the rear display. <br><br><br><b>Object Alarm Sensor</b><br><br>The rear object alarm systems are equipped with 4 ultrasonic sensors located on the rear bumpers of the vehicle. These sensors are used to monitor how close the vehicle is to an object. The object alarm sensors receive the echo signals reflected off an object of interest while the vehicle is backing up at speeds less than 8 km/h (5 mph). The object alarm sensor is a 3-wire sensor comprising of the supply voltage circuit, signal circuit and the low reference circuit. Power is provided to the object alarm sensor via the supply voltage circuit from the object <a href="3.html">alarm module</a>. The object alarm module also provides ground to the object alarm sensor via the object alarm sensor low reference circuit. The typical object detection alarm sensor signal voltage when the system is active is between 7.2-9.2 V.<br><br><br><b>Information Center Telltale Assembly</b><br><br>The information center telltale assembly visual display comprises of two amber and one red indicator. These indicators illuminate based on the vehicle distance to the object of interest. When the ignition is ON and the vehicle is placed REVERSE, the object detection system performs a bulb check on the rear display. When a malfunction exists in the object alarm system, the object <a href="3.html">alarm module</a> illuminates the information center red indicator continuously. The object alarm module provides power to the rear information center telltale assembly. The object alarm module controls the information center indicators by providing ground via the indicator control circuit when active.<br><br><br><b>Rear Object Alarm Detection System</b><br><br>When the ignition is ON and the vehicle is placed into reverse, the object detection system performs a bulb check. During the bulb check, the 3 indicators on the rear display will illuminate for approximately 2 seconds to indicate that the system is working. The object detection system performs a bulb check and operates when the following conditions are present:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is placed in REVERSE (R).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed is less than 5 mph (8 km/h).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>At speeds greater than 5 mph (8 km/h), the rear object detection system is disable. The red indicator flashes to warn the driver that the object detection system is disabled.<br><br><br><br><b>Object Detection Alarm System Operation</b><br><br>The object detection system senses how close the vehicle is to an object. The distance is determined by the 4 ultrasonic sensors located in the rear bumper. When the system detects an object while the vehicle is in reverse, one of the following will occur: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is less than 0.3 m (12 in) away from the vehicle, the amber outside, amber middle, and the red outside indicators flash and the chime sounds continuously for 5 seconds.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is less than 0.3-0.6 m (12-24 in) away from the vehicle, the amber outside, amber middle, and the red outside are ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is 0.6-1.0 m (24-40 in) away from the vehicle, the amber outside, and the amber middle indicators are ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is 1.0-2.5 m (40-98 in) away from the vehicle, the amber outside indicator is ON with a single chime and this is the first detection of an object.<br><br><br>The object detection system can detect objects 7.6 cm (3 in) wide and at least 25.4 cm (10 in) tall. It cannot detect objects above the level of the roof.<br><br><br>If the object detection system detects a malfunction, the object detection system sends a serial data message to the instrument panel cluster (IPC) to display SERVICE PARK ASSIST on the driver information center (DIC). The chime will sound and the red indicator on the information center telltale assembly illuminates continuously, notifying the driver that a malfunction exist.<br><br><br><b>Object Alarm System DIC Messages</b><br><br><b>SERVICE PARK ASSIST</b><br><br>The driver information center (DIC) displays SERVICE PARK ASSIST when the object <a href="3.html">alarm module</a> detects a malfunction in the object detection system and sends a request to the DIC for display of the message. The DIC also displays SERVICE PARK ASSIST when there is a loss of communication with the object alarm module.<br><br><b>PARK ASSIST DISABLED</b><br><br>The PARK ASSIST DISABLED message is displayed in the DIC when the object alarm system is disabled due to conditions that disable or inhibit the system. The object <a href="3.html">alarm module</a> requests the DIC via the serial data circuit to display PARK ASSIST DISABLED when it detects that one of the following conditions is true:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Object alarm system disabled through DIC vehicle customization feature. Refer to the Owners Manual for more information.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The object <a href="3.html">alarm module</a> detects that the vehicle speed is greater than 8 km/h (5 mph).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Automatic Object induced disable feature such as towing a trailer, bicycle rack.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The park brake is not fully released.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An object is hanging out of the trunk.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system receives vibrations from a large nearby vehicle or from a heavy equipment such as a jackhammer.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The sensors are not clean.<br><br><br></div>
