<h1>OnStar Reconfiguration (with TIS 2 Web Gen 4 and later)</h1><br><br><b>OnStar Reconfiguration (with TIS 2 Web Gen 4 and later)</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>The vehicle communication interface module (VCIM) has a specific set of unique numbers that tie the module to a specific vehicle. These numbers, the 10-digit station identification (STID) and 11-digit electronic serial number (ESN), are used by OnStar(R) and the cellular network to identify the specific vehicle. Because these numbers are exclusive to the vehicle identification number of the vehicle, these parts should NOT be exchanged with those of another vehicle. After replacing the VCIM, it is essential to reconfigure the OnStar(R) system. Failure to reconfigure the system will result in an additional customer visit for repair. DO NOT press and hold the white dot button on the keypad as it will not reset this version of the OnStar(R) system and may result in a DTC to be set, a red LED and limited or incomplete OnStar(R) services. Use of the TIS 2 Web SPS application and the Tech 2 are required in order to perform the VCIM configuration and setup procedure for this vehicle. The configuration and set-up procedure is now a two step process which enables an automated activation by the OnStar Center, without a button press by the technician to the center.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>It may take up to 24 hours for the OnStar(R) service to become fully activated after performing the TIS 2 Web and Tech 2 setup procedures. Perform the OnStar(R) Activation procedure only once. Repeat attempts at performing the procedure may result in a delay of the activation process.</b><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the Tech 2 to the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the Techline Information System (TIS) terminal to the Tech 2.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select the OnStar(R) Activation programming option using the service programming system (SPS) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Upon completion of the OnStar(R) Activation programming event, disconnect the TIS terminal from the Tech 2 and perform the VCIM/OnStar Set-up Procedure using the Tech 2. The set up procedure is located under the special function menu option.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The default language for the new VCIM is English. Changing the language capability to French or Spanish is supported by service programming system (SPS) and by Tech 2 special functions. Changing the language capability is also dependant on the generation of the replacement OnStar module.<br><br><br>Inform the customer that it may take up to 24 hours for the OnStar(R) service to become fully activated after performing the TIS 2 Web and Tech 2 setup procedures.<br><br></div>
