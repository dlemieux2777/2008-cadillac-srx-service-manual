<h1>Vibration Diagnostic Aids - Vibration Duplicated, Difficult to Isolate/Balance Component</h1><br><br><b>Vibration Diagnostic Aids - Vibration Duplicated, Difficult to Isolate/Balance Component</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>If you have not completed the Vibration Analysis tables as indicated and reviewed Vibration Diagnostic Aids, refer to Vibration Diagnostic Aids </b> (<a href="5103.html">Vibration Diagnostic Aids</a>)<b> BEFORE proceeding.</b><br><br><br><br>If you have duplicated the vibration concern but have had difficulty in balancing a component or isolating a component, refer to the following information.<br><br><br>Most vibration concerns are corrected or eliminated through correcting excessive runout of a component, correcting balance of a component, or isolating a component which has come into abnormal contact with another object/component.<br><br><br>Components which can generate a lot of energy and are experiencing excessive runout, imbalance, or ground-out can produce a vibration with a strong enough amplitude that the vibration can transmit to components which are closely related. This type of a condition is usually related to and sensitive to torque-load. The most likely system that could exhibit this type of a condition is the driveline.<br><br><br><b>Driveline Torque-Load Conditions</b><br><br>An drive axle that has internal conditions such as excessive runout of components, misalignment of components, imbalance, etc., can produce vibration concerns which may be transmitted into the propeller shaft, or shafts. This sort of a vibration occurrence can increase or decrease in severity based primarily upon torque-load, but can also be affected by cold or hot conditions.<br><br><br>The propeller shaft and other related components may or may not pass inspections for wear or damage, runout, alignment, etc., depending upon whether there is only one vibration source or more than one.<br><br><br><b>Difficult to System Balance the Driveline</b><br><br>If after following the Vibration Analysis - Driveline table you were instructed to system balance the driveline and you experienced difficulty in doing so while CAREFULLY following the procedures indicated-the EVA strobe readings seem to keep changing-then the axle differential to which the propeller shaft is attached should be suspected to have internal problems which are being transmitted to the propeller shaft. Refer to the drive axle diagnosis information, for internal axle diagnostics.<br><br></div>
