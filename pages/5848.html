<h1>Diagnostic Procedure Instructions</h1><br><br><b>Diagnostic Procedure Instructions</b><br><br>The following is an overview of instructions for all 16 categories which may be included in a diagnostic procedure.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Instructions</b><br><br>A link to the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a>) is provided here. This procedure should be performed prior to performing other diagnostic procedures, as this prevents misdiagnosis where there are integrated system dependencies.<br><br><br>A link to the Strategy Based Diagnosis  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a>) is provided here. This provides an overview on how a technician should diagnose a vehicle.<br><br><br>A link to the Diagnostic Procedure Instructions  is provided here. This information is an overview of instructions for all 16 categories which may be included in a diagnostic procedure.<br><br><br><b>DTC Descriptor</b><br><br>Describes what DTCs are diagnosed in this procedure. The DTC number, with Symptom Description when applicable, and descriptor are written out.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Fault Information</b><br><br>The diagnostic Fault Information table identifies each circuit that makes up an electrical subsystem and the associated circuit faults. DTCs and symptoms are listed in the table for all circuit fault modes. This information can be used to diagnose an electrical fault, or as a quick visual aid showing how the different symptoms and DTCs apply for the subsystem being diagnosed.<br><br><br>Even though all the DTCs and symptoms are shown in this table it does not mean they will all be diagnosed in the same procedure.<br><br><br>An example table from an engine coolant temperature (ECT) procedure:<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/793418199.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><b>Typical Scan Tool Data</b><br><br>The Typical Scan Tool Data table identifies a scan tool data parameter and its value in reference to potential circuit faults.<br><br><br>An example table from an ECT procedure:<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/793420126.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Description</b><br><br>Circuit/System Description identifies how a circuit/system normally functions.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br>Conditions for Running the DTC, identifies what conditions must be present to allow the diagnostic to run.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br>Conditions for Setting the DTC, identifies the condition(s) that must be present in order to fail the diagnostic and when to set the DTC.<br><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br>Actions Taken When the DTC sets, identifies the default actions taken when a <a href="2303.html">control module</a> sets a DTC.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Clearing the DTC</b><br><br>Conditions for Clearing the DTC, identifies the conditions that must be met in order to clear the DTC.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br>Diagnostic Aids are suggestions which explain other methods to diagnose the condition. It also provides unique information about the system used to assist the technician in finding and repairing a vehicle condition.<br><br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><br>Reference Information includes links providing additional information for the diagnostic procedure.<br><br><br>For example:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Schematic Reference<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector End View Reference<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Description and Operation<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electrical Information Reference<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC Type Reference <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Scan Tool Reference<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Special Tools Required<br><br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br>The diagnostic format does not force a technician to any of the 3 diagnostic categories (Circuit/System Verification, Circuit/System Testing and Component Testing). However, performing the Circuit/System Verification category first, aids in determining if a vehicle condition is current. This category also serves to route the technician to another diagnostic procedure which should be performed first; for example, a DTC with a higher priority.<br><br><br>Circuit/System Verification is a non-intrusive procedure outlining how to verify that a system or a portion of a system is functioning correctly. During the verification process, the vehicle is kept intact and tested as a complete system. This verification is used to assist the technician in determining whether a condition is current or intermittent. When a condition is determined to be intermittent, a technician can use the link in Electrical Information Reference: Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>) .<br><br><br>The technician should be able to identify if the fault is occurring on the input circuit - signal or on the output circuit - control when applicable. The technician will need to decide from the verification results if the system is working correctly or if further diagnosis needs to be performed in either Circuit/System Testing and/or Component Testing.<br><br><br><b>Circuit/System Testing</b><br><br>The diagnostic format does not force a technician to any of the 3 diagnostic categories (Circuit/System Verification, Circuit/System Testing and Component Testing). However, beginning with the Circuit/System Verification category aids in determining if a vehicle condition is current.<br><br><br>Circuit/System Testing is a step by step, positive-flow, testing sequence which allows the technician to perform each test step, in sequence, until a fault is detected. If the result of a test step is achieved, the normal flow is to proceed to the next step. If the result is NOT achieved, the repair arrow bullet (-->) will identify what actions need to take place.<br><br><br>Intrusive diagnostics are performed to locate the system fault. System harness connections are disconnected from the module or component to test individual circuit functions. The module or component will be used to assist in verifying the circuit function. When a test does not pass, the repair steps (-->) will indicate what circuit faults to test. For example, short to voltage, short to ground or open/high resistance. <br><br><br>When testing for individual circuit faults, the technician is expected to include terminal inspections such as connection surfaces and terminal tension at both the harness and component/module. Additionally, a technician can use the links in Electrical Information Reference: Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>) or Circuit Testing  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>) .<br><br><br>The <a href="2303.html">control modules</a> and components will also be diagnosed during these test steps. A retest of a control module or component should always be performed before replacement. For example, re-connect all components and modules and retest the system to verify the condition still exists before replacing modules or components.<br><br><br><b>Component Testing</b><br><br>The diagnostic format does not force a technician to any of the 3 diagnostic categories (Circuit/System Verification, Circuit/System Testing and Component Testing). However, beginning with the Circuit/System Verification category aids in determining if a vehicle condition is current.<br><br><br>Component Testing can offer static and/or dynamic component tests. These tests can be used to verify if a component is operating correctly to avoid unnecessary replacement.<br><br><br>Testing modules in this category will not be offered. In most cases, the module is used to verify the harness circuits in the Circuit/System Testing category and a retest of the module should always be performed before replacement.<br><br><br><b>Repair Instructions</b><br><br>Repair Instructions provides a link to Diagnostic Repair Verification  (<a href="7774.html">Verification Tests</a>) . This link describes how to verify the vehicle is repaired.<br><br><br>All links to Repair or Replacement procedures are located here.<br><br><br><b>Repair Verification</b><br><br>Repair Verification describes how to verify the vehicle is repaired when additional instructions are needed beyond what is in Diagnostic Repair Verification.<br><br></div>
