TCM power will produce heat that is absorbed by the internal heat sink. As long as the heat sink and the controller base plate stay below 142&deg;C (288&deg;F), the TCM will stay operational (no overtemperature shut down). This DTC indicates the TCM is in an overtemperature condition and the TCM has shut down to protect it from possible heat damage. This fault is handled inside the TCM and no external circuits are involved. The TCM will remain off until the overtemperature condition no longer exists. <br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition voltage is between 8.6-18.0 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The TCM temperature is greater than 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) and less than 240&deg;C (464&deg;F) for greater than 0.25 seconds.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC P0634 is not currently active and has not failed in the current key on.<br><br><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><b>Condition 1</b><br><br>The TCM has detected an internal overtemperature condition greater than 142&deg;C (288&deg;F) for 5 seconds.<br><br><b>Condition 2</b><br><br>Ignition voltage is equal to or greater than 18 volts and the TCM temperature is greater than 50&deg;C (122&deg;F) for 2 seconds.<br><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC P0634 is a Type A DTC.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The TCM shifts to a default gear, shuts down, and turns OFF.<br><br><br><br><b>Conditions for Clearing the DTC</b><br><br>DTC P0634 is a Type A DTC.<br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br>Inspect the transmission cooler, transmission fluid lines, engine cooling system, and transmission fluid level, and inspect for any obstructions in the cooling system airflow which may cause an overheat condition.
