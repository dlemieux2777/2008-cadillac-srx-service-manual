<h1>Restraints - Seat Belt Latching Issues/Warning Lights</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>09-09-40-001B<br><br><b>Date: </b>January 13, 2012<br><br><b>Subject: </b><a href="3894.html">Seat Belt Buckle</a> Latching Issues and/or Seat Belt Warning Lights Illuminated<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2013 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks <br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 09-09-40-001A (Section 09 - Restraints).<br><br>This bulletin is being published to advise dealers about <a href="3894.html">seat belt buckles</a> not operating and/or seat belt warning light illumination, as well as difficulty latching and unlatching the buckle or the buckle release button sticking.<br><br>Analysis of warranty data has determined that this condition may be caused by sticky beverages being spilled onto or into the <a href="3894.html">seat belt buckle</a> assembly. Foreign debris from food, candy wrappers, paper and coins can also contribute to this condition.<br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>If foreign material (debris) or sticky liquids are the cause of the concern, show the customer the condition of the component (buckle assembly) and explain how it is affecting the function of the restraint system. Strongly recommend that the component be replaced. Point out the fact that this is not a manufacturing defect and is not covered by the new vehicle warranty. If the customer declines to have parts replaced, the service department management must make a notation on the service record that the lack of functionality of seating position with an inoperative buckle was fully explained to the customer. The service department management must advise the customer that having a non-functioning buckle in a seating position voids ability to use that seating position (no one should ride in the seat). Also make the customer aware that it may be against the law to ride in a vehicle without wearing a restraint system.</b><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>Never insert anything other than the <a>seat belt latch</a> plate into the buckle assembly. Do not attempt to dig anything out of a buckle with a tool. Never try to wash out a buckle to remove a spilled liquid as this may damage the buckle.</b><br><br>Use the following steps to determine the cause of the concern.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the buckle assembly with a light shining on the latch plate insertion area.
