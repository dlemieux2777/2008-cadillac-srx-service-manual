Certain conditions can cause multiple symptoms. These conditions are listed together under Symptoms Testing. Conditions that may only cause specific symptoms are listed separately under Additional Symptoms Testing. Perform the Symptoms Testing before using the Additional Symptoms Testing. <br><br><br><b>Symptoms Definition</b><br>Backfire<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel ignites in the intake manifold or in the exhaust system, making a loud popping noise.<br><br>Cuts Out, Misses<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A steady pulsation or jerking that follows engine speed, which is usually more pronounced as the engine load increases. This condition is not normally felt above 1,500 RPM or 48 km/h (30 mph). The exhaust has a steady spitting sound at idle or at low speed.<br><br>Detonation/Spark Knock<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A mild to severe ping which usually occurs worse while under acceleration. The engine makes sharp metallic knocks that change with throttle opening.<br><br>Dieseling, Run-On<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine continues to run after the key is turned OFF, but runs very rough.<br><br>Hard Start<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine cranks OK, but does not start for a long time. The vehicle does eventually run, or may start but immediately stall.<br><br>Hesitation, Sag, Stumble<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A momentary lack of response as the accelerator is pushed down. This condition can occur at any vehicle speed. This condition is usually more pronounced when first trying to make the vehicle move, as from a stop. This condition may cause the engine to stall in severe conditions.<br><br>Lack of Power, Sluggishness, or Sponginess<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine delivers less than expected power. Little or no increase in vehicle speed when the accelerator pedal is pushed down part way.<br><br>Poor Fuel Economy<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fuel economy, as measured by an actual road test, is noticeably lower than expected. Also, the fuel economy is noticeably lower than it was on this vehicle at one time, as previously shown by an actual road test.<br><br>Rough, Unstable, or Incorrect Idle and Stalling<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine runs unevenly at idle. If severe, the engine or the vehicle may shake. Engine <a href="960.html">idle speed</a> may vary. Either condition may be severe enough to stall the engine.<br><br>Surges/Chuggles<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An engine power variation under steady throttle or cruise. Feels like the vehicle speeds up and slows down with no change in the accelerator pedal position.<br><br><br><br><br><b>Symptoms Verification</b><br><br>Before using the Symptom tables, perform the following inspections:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the engine control module (ECM) and malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) are operating correctly.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that there are no diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that are stored.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the scan tool data is within a normal operating range.

The visual/physical inspection is extremely important, and can lead to correcting a condition without additional testing. It may also help reveal the cause of an intermittent condition.<br><br><br><b>Identifying Intermittent Conditions</b><br><br>Many intermittent conditions occur with harness or connector movement due to engine torque, rough pavement, vibration or physical movements of a component.
