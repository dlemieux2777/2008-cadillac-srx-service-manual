<h1>Air Bag(s) Arming and Disarming: Service and Repair</h1><br><br><b>SIR Disabling and Enabling</b><br><br>SIR component location affects how a vehicle should be serviced. There are parts of the SIR system installed in various locations around a vehicle. To find the location of the SIR components refer to SIR Identification Views  (<a href="3819.html">Locations</a>) .<br><br><br>There are several reasons for disabling the SIR system, such as repairs to the SIR system or servicing a component near or attached to an SIR component. There are several ways to disable the SIR system depending on what type of service is being performed. The following information covers the proper procedures for disabling/enabling the SIR system.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/142588555.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>SIR Service Precautions</b><br><br><b>Caution:</b>  When performing service on or near the SIR components or the SIR wiring, the SIR system must be disabled. Failure to observe the correct procedure could cause deployment of the SIR components. Serious injury can occur. Failure to observe the correct procedure could also result in unnecessary SIR system repairs.<br><br><br>The inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) maintains a reserved energy supply. The reserved energy supply provides deployment power for the air bags if the SDM loses battery power during a collision. Deployment power is available for as much as 1 minute after disconnecting the vehicle power. Waiting 1 minute before working on the system after disabling the SIR system prevents deployment of the air bags from the reserved energy supply.<br><br><b>General Service Instructions </b><br><br>The following are general service instructions which must be followed in order to properly repair the vehicle and return it to its original integrity:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not expose inflator modules to temperatures above 65&deg;C (150&deg;F). <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify the correct replacement part number. Do not substitute a component from a different vehicle. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use only original GM replacement parts available from your authorized GM dealer. Do not use salvaged parts for repairs to the SIR system. <br><br><br>Discard any of the following components if it has been dropped from a height of 91 cm (3 feet) or greater:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Any Inflatable restraint air bag module <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflatable restraint steering wheel module coil <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Any Inflatable restraint sensor <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflatable restraint seat belt pretensioners <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflatable restraint Passenger Presence System (PPS) module or sensor<br><br><br><br><b>Disabling Procedure - Air Bag Fuse</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the steering wheel so that the vehicles <a href="3624.html">wheels</a> are pointing straight ahead. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the ignition in the OFF position. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>The SDM may have more than one fused power input.
