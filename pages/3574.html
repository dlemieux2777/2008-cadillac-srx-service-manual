<h1>Front Suspension</h1><br><br><b>General Description</b><br><br>The front <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> has 2 primary purposes:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Isolate the driver from irregularities in the road surface.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Define the ride and handling characteristics of the vehicle.<br><br><br>The front <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> absorbs the impact of the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> travelling over irregular road surfaces and dissipates this energy throughout the suspension system. This process isolates the vehicle occupants from the road surface. The rate at which the suspension dissipates the energy and the amount of energy that is absorbed is how the suspension defines the vehicle's ride characteristics. Ride characteristics are designed into the suspension system and are not adjustable. The ride characteristics are mentioned in this description in order to aid in the understanding of the functions of the suspension system. The suspension system must allow for the vertical movement of the tire and wheel assembly as the vehicle travels over irregular road surfaces while maintaining the tire's horizontal relationship to the road.<br><br><br>This requires that the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> knuckle be suspended between an upper and a lower control arm. The lower control arm attaches from the steering knuckle at the outermost point of the <a href="3464.html">control arm</a>. The attachment is through a ball and socket type joint. The innermost end of the control arm attached at 2 points to the vehicle frame, through semi-rigid bushings. The upper control arm attaches to the upper control arm bracket and is part of the front shock module assembly that bolts to the body. Between the upper control arm bracket assembly and the seat on the shock, isolated by insulators under compression, is a coil spring.<br><br><br>This up and down motion of the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> knuckle as the vehicle travels over bumps is absorbed predominantly by the coil spring. The vertical movement of the steering knuckle as the vehicle travels over irregular road surfaces will tend to compress the spring and spring tension will lead the spring to return to the original, at-rest state. This action isolates the vehicle from the road surface. The lower control arms are allowed to pivot at the vehicle frame in a vertical fashion. The upper <a href="3464.html">control arms</a> are allowed to pivot on the upper control arm bracket. The <a href="3463.html">ball joint</a> allows the steering knuckle to maintain the perpendicular relationship to the road surface.<br><br><br>A shock absorber is used in conjunction with this system in order to dampen out the oscillations of the coil spring. A shock absorber is a basic hydraulic cylinder. The shock is filled with oil and has a moveable shaft that connects to a piston inside the shock absorber. Valves inside the shock absorber offer resistance to oil flow and consequently inhibit rapid movement of the piston and shaft. Each end of the shock absorber is connected in such a fashion to utilize this recoil action of a spring alone.<br><br><br>Front suspensions systems utilize a stabilizer shaft. The <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/Stabilizer%20Bar/">stabilizer bar</a> connects between the left and right lower control arm assemblies through the <a href="3473.html">stabilizer link</a> and stabilizer shaft insulators. This bar controls the amount of independent movement of the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> when the vehicle turns. Limiting the independent movement defines the vehicle's handling characteristics on turns. <br><br></div>
