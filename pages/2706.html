Other regulations may also apply in other locations. Always know and follow these regulations when handling batteries.</b><br><br><br><br>Batteries that are no longer wanted must be disposed of by an approved battery recycler and must never be thrown in the trash or sent to a landfill. <br><br><br>Batteries that are not part of the vehicle itself, not the battery under the hood, must only be transported on public streets for business purposes via approved hazardous material transportation procedures. <br><br><br>Battery storage, charging and testing facilities in repair shops must meet various requirements for ventilation, safety equipment, material segregation, etc.<br><br><br>The maintenance free battery is standard. There are no vent plugs in the cover. The battery is completely sealed except for 2 small vent holes in the side. These vent holes allow the small amount of gas that is produced in the battery to escape.<br><br><br>The battery has 3 functions as a major source of energy:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine cranking<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Voltage stabilizer<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Alternate source of energy with generator overload<br><br><br><br>The battery specification label, example below, contains information about the following:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The test ratings<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The original equipment catalog number<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The recommended replacement model number<br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/573295505.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><b>Battery Ratings</b><br><br>A battery has 2 ratings:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Reserve capacity<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cold cranking amperage<br><br><br>When a battery is replaced use a battery with similar ratings.
