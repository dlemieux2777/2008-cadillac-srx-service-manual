<h1>Cruise Control: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b><a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> Description and Operation</b><br><br><a href="5143.html">Cruise control</a> is a speed control system that maintains a desired vehicle speed under normal driving conditions at speeds above 40 km/h (25 mph). Steep grades may cause variations in the selected vehicle speeds.<br><br><br>The following are the main components of the <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The accelerator pedal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The brake pedal position (BPP) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The body control module (BCM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The cruise on/off switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="5143.html">cruise control</a> cancel switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The + RES switch (equivalent to resume/accel switch)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The - SET switch (equivalent to set/coast switch)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine control module (ECM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The throttle actuator control (TAC) motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed sensor<br><br><br>The body control module (BCM) monitors the signal circuit of the <a>cruise control switches</a>, which are located on the steering wheel. The BCM relays the cruise control switch status to the engine control module (ECM) via the GMLAN serial data circuit. The ECM uses the status of the cruise control switch to determine when to capture and maintain the vehicle speed. The ECM monitors the vehicle speed signal circuit in order to determine the desired vehicle speed. The ECM uses the TAC motor in order to maintain the vehicle speed. For further information on the TAC system, refer to Throttle Actuator Control (TAC) System Description  (<a href="1022.html">Throttle Actuator Control (TAC) System Description</a>) for the 2.8L, 3.0L, 3.2L or 3.6L engine or to Throttle Actuator Control (TAC) System Description  (<a href="1022.html">Throttle Actuator Control (TAC) System Description</a>) for the 4.6L engine.<br><br><br>Voltage is supplied to the <a>cruise control switch</a> via the steering wheel control switch reference voltage circuit supplied by the BCM. The <a href="5143.html">cruise control</a> function switches are arranged in a resistive ladder design, with each cruise control function switch having a different resistance value. The BCM detects a specific voltage value that is associated with the cruise control function switch being activated. When the normally open cruise control on/off switch is turned ON, the switch closes and the BCM supplies a ground to the cruise control switch ON indicator circuit as it becomes illuminated. The BCM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the ECM indicating that the on/off switch is active. Similarly, when the normally open + RES switch or the normally open - SET switch are pressed, the switch closes and the BCM detects the predetermined voltage signal on the cruise control resume/accel and set/coast switch signal circuit. The BCM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the ECM indicating that the + RES switch or the - SET switch is active. The + RES switch or the - SET switch will remain inactive when the BCM has not received the predetermined voltage signal from the on/off switch.<br><br><br><b><a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> Engaged</b><br><br>The <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System will engage and adjust vehicle speeds, based on the activation of the following <a>cruise control switches</a>, which are located on the steering wheel:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On/Off<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>+ RES<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>- SET<br><br><br>To engage the <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System, ensure that the vehicle speed is above 40.2 km/h (25 mph), turn the cruise On/Off switch ON and momentarily press the - SET switch. The ECM will engage the Cruise Control System and record the vehicle speed. The ECM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the instrument panel cluster (IPC) in order to illuminate the Cruise Engaged indicator in the IPC.<br><br><br>Pressing the accelerator pedal while the <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System is engaged, allows the driver to override the Cruise Control System in order to accelerate the vehicle beyond the current set vehicle speed. When the accelerator pedal is released, the vehicle will decelerate and resume the current set vehicle speed. The driver can also override the current set vehicle speed via the - SET switch and the + RES switch. When the Cruise Control System is engaged, pressing and holding the - SET switch will allow the vehicle to decelerate from the current set vehicle speed without deactivating the Cruise Control System. When the - SET switch is released, the ECM will record the vehicle speed and maintain the vehicle speed as the new set vehicle speed. When the Cruise Control System is engaged, momentarily pressing the - SET switch will allow the vehicle to decelerate at 1.6 km/h (1 mph) increments for each time that the - SET is momentarily pressed, with a minimum vehicle speed of 37 km/h (23 mph). <br><br><br>Pressing and holding the + RES switch, when the <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System is engaged, will allow the vehicle to accelerate to a greater vehicle speed than the current set vehicle speed. When the + RES switch is released, the ECM will record the vehicle speed and maintain the vehicle speed as the new set vehicle speed. When the Cruise Control System is engaged, momentarily pressing the + RES switch will allow the vehicle to accelerate at 1.6 km/h (1 mph) increments for each time that the + RES switch is momentarily pressed, with the maximum acceleration total of 16 km/h (10 mph) over the current set vehicle speed. Momentarily activating the + RES switch will recall the previous vehicle speed, after the cruise control system is disengaged by pressing the brake pedal, or CANCEL switch.<br><br><br><b><a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> Disengaged</b><br><br>The engine control module (ECM) disengages the <a href="5143.html">cruise control</a> operation based on the signals from the following switches:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The brake pedal position (BPP) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The On/Off switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="5143.html">cruise control</a> cancel switch<br><br><br>The <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System will disengage when the brake pedal is applied. The body control module (BCM) monitors the BPP sensor via the BPP sensor signal circuit as the voltage signal increases while the pedal reaches the fully applied position. The ECM monitors the BPP signal through a discrete input and a GMLAN serial data message signal from the BCM indicating the brake status. When both signals indicate the brake pedal is applied, the ECM will disengage the cruise control system. For further information on the BPP sensor, refer to Exterior Lighting Systems Description and Operation  (<a href="5434.html">Exterior Lighting Systems Description and Operation</a>) and to Brake Pedal Position Sensor Calibration  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) .<br><br><br>The <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System will also disengage when the cruise control on/off switch is switched OFF, or the cruise control cancel switch is activated. The body control module (BCM) determines when the cruise control cancel switch is activated. When the normally open cancel switch is closed, the BCM detects the predetermined voltage signal on the cruise control function switch circuit. The vehicle speed stored in the memory of the engine control module will be erased when the cruise control On/Off switch is turned OFF, or the ignition switch is turned OFF. The BCM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the ECM in order to disengage the cruise control system. The Cruise Control System will disengage when the ECM detects that a driver override function has been active for approximately 60 seconds. When the Cruise Control System has been disengaged, the ECM sends a GMLAN serial message to the instrument panel cluster (IPC) in order to turn OFF the Cruise Engaged indicator.<br><br><br>Every time the <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System is disengaged, the ECM will keep track of the reason for system disengagement. The last 8 disengagement reasons will be recorded within the ECM memory. The scan tool will display the last 8 Cruise Disengage History parameters, in which one out of approximately 50 possible reasons will be displayed in each of these 8 parameters. For the disengagement reason to be displayed within the scan tool parameter either the Cruise Control System is active and disengagement is requested, or engagement of the system is requested but a fault is present. For a list of each disengagement reason along with each definition, refer to Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) in the ECM Scan Tool Information.<br><br><br><b><a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> Inhibited</b><br><br>The engine control module (ECM) inhibits the <a href="5143.html">cruise control</a> operation when any of the following conditions exist:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM has not detected a brake pedal activation from the body control module (BCM).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A <a href="5143.html">Cruise Control</a> System DTC has been set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed is less than 40.2 km/h (25 mph).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed is too high.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is in PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, or 1st gear.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine RPM is low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine RPM is high.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system voltage is not between 9 volts and 16 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Antilock Brake System (ABS)/Traction Control System (TCS) is active for more than 2 seconds.<br><br><br></div>
