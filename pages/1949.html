<h1>Control Solenoid Valve and Transmission Control Module Assembly Solenoid Performance Test</h1><br><br><b>Control Solenoid Valve and Transmission Control Module Assembly Solenoid Performance Test</b><br><br><b>Tools Required</b><br><br>DT-47825 Control Solenoid Test Plate<br><br>The purpose of this procedure is to test the operation of the control solenoid (w/body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly for a stuck open or stuck closed solenoid. The DT-47825  bolts to the mounting surface of the control solenoid (w/body and TCM) valve assembly. Compressed air is attached to the test block, through the control solenoid (w/body and TCM) valve assembly solenoid passage and back to a pressure gage on the test plate, sent through the control solenoid (w/body and TCM) valve assembly solenoid, and back to the test plate pressure port. <br><br><br>An air pressure gage is used to display the air passing through the solenoid. If the solenoid is unable to allow air through or the air is constantly flowing through the solenoid may be stuck. The scan tool is used to command the solenoids On and Off while watching the air pressure test gage to determine if the solenoid is functioning correctly. The recommended shop air pressure for this test is 620.5-689.4 Kpa (90-100 psi).<br><br><b>Control Solenoid (w/Body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) Valve Assembly with Control Solenoid Test Plate</b><br><br><h3>Control Solenoid (w/Body and TCM) Valve Assembly with Control Solenoid Test Plate:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/483536120.png"></div><br><br><br><b>1</b> - Filter Plate Assembly<br><b>2</b> - Control Solenoid Valve Assembly<br><b>3</b> - DT-47825 Control Solenoid Test Plate<br><b>4</b> - Air Connection Port<br><b>5</b> - Transmission 16-Way Pass-Through Connector<br><b>6</b> - Electrical Connector Slide Lock<br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>To avoid solenoid overheating and possible internal damage, do not continuously operate the solenoid for more than 2 minutes at a time.</b><br><br><br><br>The <a href="2303.html">TCM</a> will normally cycle some of the transmission solenoids On and Off to keep the solenoid passages clean and clear, This is a normal function and will cause the valves to cycle open and closed quickly when the TCM is powered up. This will make the pressure gage needle flicker or move from high and low as the valves open and close, allowing air to exit the ports where the pressure gage is not connected.<br><br><br>It is necessary to drain the control solenoid (w/body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly of all remaining transmission fluid before attaching the test plate. Use caution when attaching air to the test plate, as any remaining transmission fluid in the control solenoid (w/body and TCM) valve assembly will be forced out. Use shop towels to cover the test plate ports in order to prevent fluid from being released into the air.<br><br><br><b>Preliminary Procedures</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise and support the vehicle. Refer to Lifting and Jacking the Vehicle  (<a href="7887.html">Service and Repair</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the transmission fluid pan and filter. Refer to Automatic Transmission Fluid, Fluid Pan and/or Filter Replacement  (<a href="0.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Automatic%20Transmission%2FTransaxle/Service%20and%20Repair/Removal%20and%20Replacement/">Removal and Replacement</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the transmission electrical connector. Refer to Automatic Transmission Electrical Connector Passage Sleeve Replacement  (<a href="8357.html">Automatic Transmission Electrical Connector Passage Sleeve Replacement</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the control solenoid (w/body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly from the transmission. Refer to Control Valve Lower Body and Upper Body Replacement  (<a href="7981.html">Service and Repair</a>) .<br><br><br><b>Solenoid Testing Procedure</b><br><br><h3>Solenoid Testing Procedure:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/483561813.png"></div><br><br><br><b>1</b> - Regulated Air Supply<br><b>2</b> - Test Ports<br><b>3</b> - Scan Tool<br><b>4</b> - Test Pressure Gage<br><b>5</b> - Electrical Connector Sleeve<br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b>  The <a href="2303.html">TCM</a> connector sleeve allows the test tool harness to be correctly orientated for electrical operation of the TCM. Do not connect the test harness to the TCM without using the connector sleeve. Failure to use the sleeve could allow the test harness to be incorrectly positioned which will result in permanent TCM damage. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Align and install the electrical connector sleeve to the control solenoid (w/body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly and secure with the connector slide lock.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If necessary, clean each side of the filter plate assembly and install the filter plate assembly back on the control solenoid (w/body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly. Clean the mounting surface of the DT-47825  .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Bolt the DT-47825  to the control solenoid (w/body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly mounting surface. Use the bolts and washers supplied with the tool to attach the test block. Tighten the bolts to 5 N.m (44 lb in).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the test harness supplied with the DT-47825  to the vehicle harness and to the <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>. Engage the connector locks.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect shop air to the DT-47825  air inlet. Do not exceed the recommended air pressure of 620.5-689.4 Kpa (90-100 psi).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the ignition ON and the scan tool communicating with the vehicle, command the solenoid in question On and Off. Watch the air pressure gage for a change as you command the solenoid. Refer to Control Solenoid (w/Body and <a href="2303.html">TCM</a>) Valve Assembly Solenoid Performance Test Plate to Component Identification for correct solenoid function and test plate port connections for the solenoid being tested.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The solenoid should allow air pressure to flow or prevent air pressure flow depending on the solenoid state. The test results are read on the pressure gage.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Command the solenoid valve On and Off several times to determine the condition of the solenoid in question. Release the test air pressure from the pressure the gage between solenoid tests.<br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/483588305.png"></div><br><br><br><br></div>
