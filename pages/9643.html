<h1>Tires - Minimizing Damage to TPM Sensors</h1>INFORMATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 08-03-10-007<br><br>Date: May 16, 2008<br><br>Subject: <br>Minimizing Damage to Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) Sensors During Tire Mounting/Dismounting<br><br>Models:<br>2009 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks (including Saturn)<br>2009 and Prior HUMMER H2, H3<br>2009 and Prior Saab 9-7X<br><br>with Wheel Mounted <a href="3604.html">Tire Pressure Sensors</a><br><br>Minimizing Damage To TPM Sensors<br><br>All GM vehicles now in production and sold in the U.S., as well as many vehicles sold in Canada, feature Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems that have valve stem mounted <a href="3604.html">Tire Pressure Sensors</a>. When dismounting and mounting tires, care must be taken when breaking the bead loose from the wheel. If the tire machines bead breaking fixture is positioned too close to the tire pressure sensor, as the tire bead breaks away from the wheel it may be forced into, or catch on the edge of the tire pressure sensor. This can damage the sensor and require the sensor to be replaced.<br><br>Care must also be taken when transferring the tire bead to the other side of the wheel rim. As the tire machine rotates and the tire bead is stretched around the wheel rim, the bead can come in contact with the sensor if it is not correctly positioned in relation to the mounting/dismounting head prior to tire mounting/dismounting. This can also cause sensor damage requiring replacement.<br><br>Procedure<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Use a tire changing machine in order to dismount tires. Do not use hand tools or tire irons alone in order to remove the tire from the wheel. Damage to the tire beads or the wheel rim could result.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Do not scratch or damage the clear coating on aluminum wheels with the tire changing equipment. Scratching the clear coating could cause the aluminum wheel to corrode and the clear coating to peel from the wheel.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the valve core from the valve stem.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Deflate the tire completely.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Rim-clamp European-type tire changers are recommended.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the tire changer in order to remove the tire from the wheel.

The tire iron or pry bar can be inserted when prying the outer tire bead up and over the mounting/dismounting head.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/120787987.png"></div><br><br><br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the wheel and tire so that the valve stem is situated again at the 2 o'clock position relative to the head. The tire iron or pry bar can be inserted when prying the inner tire bead up and over the mounting/dismounting head.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove all residual liquid sealant from the inside of the tire and wheel surfaces. If any tire sealant is noted upon tire dismounting on vehicles equipped with TPM replace the <a href="3604.html">tire pressure sensor</a>.<br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use a wire brush or coarse steel wool in order to remove any rubber, light rust or corrosion from the wheel bead seats.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If bead seat corrosion has been identified as an air loss concern on the wheel being worked on, refer to GM Service Bulletin # 08-03-10-006 for additional information on correcting the leak.<br><br>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply GM P/N 12345884 (in Canada, P/N 5728223) or equivalent to the tire bead and the wheel rim.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/120796146.png"></div><br><br><br><br>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using the tire machine, rotate the tire/wheel assembly clockwise when transferring the tire bead to the inside of the wheel rim.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/120807183.png"></div><br><br><br><br>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the rim so that the valve stem (1) is situated at the 3 o'clock position relative to the head (2).

The bead may break when the bead snaps over the safety hump. Do not exceed 275 kPa (40 psi) pressure when inflating any tire if beads are not seated. If 275 kPa (40 psi) pressure will not seat the beads, deflate, lubricate the beads and reinflate. Overinflating may cause the bead to break and cause serious personal injury.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Allowable bead seating pressure is 345 kPa (50 psi) on Extended Mobility Tires.<br><br>14.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflate the tire until it passes the bead humps. Be sure that the valve core is not installed at this time.<br><br>15.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the valve core to the valve core stem.<br><br>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflate the tire to the proper air pressure.<br><br>17.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the locating rings are visible on both sides of the tire in order to verify that the tire bead is fully seated on the wheel.<br><br>Parts Information<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/120835676.png"></div><br><br><br><br>The product shown above is available from GM SPO.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
