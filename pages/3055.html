If the CCA and RC are higher, then the battery run down time would be longer. If the CCA and RC are lower, then the battery run down time would be shorter. The graph below indicates roughly how many days a 690 CCA battery with at 110 min. RC (60.5 AH) starting at 80 percent state of charge will last with a constant current draw until it reaches 50 percent state of charge. Differences in battery rating and temperature will affect the results. <br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/598788306.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><b>Load Test</b><br><b>Caution:</b>  Refer to Battery Disconnect Caution  (<a href="2703.html">Battery Disconnect Caution</a>) .<br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Do not turn the parasitic draw test switch to the OFF position with the engine running.

Refer to Battery Usage  (<a href="2710.html">Battery Usage</a>) .<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Divide the reserve capacity by 4, amp hour rating by 2.4. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Compare this to the multimeter milliampere reading taken in the previous step. The parasitic current drain should not exceed this number.

This will determine if something has been activated during that time frame.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b>  The test switch must be in the ON position when removing the fuses in order to maintain continuity in the electrical system. This avoids damaging the digital multimeter due to accidental overloading, such as a door being opened to change a fuse.<br><br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>Removing fuses, relays, and connectors to determine the failure area may wake up modules.

This will indicate which circuit is causing the drain. Refer to Power Distribution Schematics  (<a href="0.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Power%20and%20Ground%20Distribution/Diagrams/Electrical%20Diagrams/Power%20Distribution%20Diagrams/">Power Distribution Diagrams</a>) to diagnose exactly which part of the suspect circuit is causing the parasitic drain. In some cases a non-fused circuit or component, such as a relay, is the cause of excessive parasitic current drain. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Repeat the parasitic current drain test procedure after any repair has been completed to make sure that the parasitic current drain is at an acceptable level. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When the cause of the excessive current drain has been located and repaired, remove the J 38758  .<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>20.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the battery negative cable to the battery negative terminal.<br><br><br></div>
