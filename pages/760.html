<h1>Cooling Fan Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Control - Two Fan System</b><br><br>The engine cooling fan system consists of 2 puller type electrical cooling fans and 3 fan relays. The relays are arranged in a Series Parallel (S/P) configuration that allows the engine control module (ECM) to operate both fans together at low or high speeds. The cooling fans and fan relays receive battery positive voltage from the underhood fuse block. The ground path is provided at G104.<br><br><br>During low speed operation, the ECM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the low speed fan relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and supplies battery positive voltage from the low fan fuse through the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit to the left cooling fan. The ground path for the left cooling fan is through the cooling fan S/P relay and the right cooling fan. The result is a series circuit with both fans running at low speed.<br><br><br>During high speed operation the ECM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. After a 3 second delay, the ECM supplies a ground path for the high speed fan relay and the cooling fan S/P relay through the high speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the cooling fan S/P relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and provides a ground path for the left cooling fan. At the same time, the high speed fan relay coil is energized closing the relay contacts, and provides battery positive voltage from the high fan fuse on the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit, to the right cooling fan. During high speed fan operation, both engine cooling fans have their own ground path. The result is a parallel circuit with both fans running at high speed.<br><br><br>At idle and very low vehicle speeds the cooling fans are only allowed to increase in speed, if required. This ensures idle stability by preventing the fans from cycling between high and low speed.<br><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Control - Three Fan System</b><br><br>The engine cooling fan system consists of a mechanical fan, 2 electrical pusher-type cooling fans, and 3 fan relays.
