<h1>Wiper/Washer System Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Wiper/Washer System Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Wiper/Washer System Components</b><br><br>The Wiper/Washer System consists of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Windshield wiper/washer switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Body control module (BCM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Heated washer nozzles<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>WPR Relay<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>WPR HI Relay<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Windshield wiper motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Windshield washer fluid pump<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Windshield washer fluid level switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Instrument panel cluster (IPC)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>WPR Fuse 25 A<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>WSW/PUMP Fuse 10 A<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>RAP Fuse 10 A<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>MIS IGN Fuse 10 A<br><br><br><br><b>Power and Grounds</b><br><br>With the ignition in the ON position, accessory voltage is supplied through the 25A WPR fuse to the <a href="5734.html">WIPER relay</a>, the WIPER HI relay and the WSH relay that are all located in the underhood fuse block. Refer to Wiper/Washer Schematics  (<a href="5813.html">[1]</a><a href="6725.html">[2]</a><a>Electrical Diagrams</a>) .<br><br><br>G101 provides ground for the windshield wiper motor. G104 provides ground for the WPR relay, the WPR HI relay, the windshield washer fluid pump and the windshield washer fluid level switch.<br><br><br><b>Modes of Operation</b><br><br>The normal wiper system function positions are as follows:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>MIST<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DELAY<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>MANUAL LOW<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>MANUAL HIGH<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>WASH<br><br><br><br><b>Automatic Modes of Operation</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>AUTOMATIC DELAY<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>AUTOMATIC LOW<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>AUTOMATIC HIGH<br><br><br>Automatic low speed and automatic high speed wiper modes are continuous wiper operations that are controlled by the outside moisture sensor. Automatic low and high speed operation is utilized when the amount of precipitation on the windshield exceeds the automatic delay or low threshold.<br><br><br><b>Low Speed Operation </b><br><br>When the <a href="5735.html">wiper switch</a> is in the low speed position, ground is applied through a resistor internal to the switch and the wiper switch low signal circuit to the body control module (BCM). In response to this signal, the BCM energizes the WPR relay by applying battery voltage through the <a href="5734.html">wiper relay</a> control circuit to the coil side of the relay. This allows battery positive voltage from the WPR fuse to flow through the switch input side of the WPR relay and out to the switch input side of the WPR HI relay. Since the wiper high relay is de-energized and its switch contacts are normally closed to the low speed control circuit of the windshield wiper motor, the motor will operate at low speed.<br><br><br><a href="5733.html">Wiper motor</a> low speed operation and the WPR relay can also be commanded ON/OFF by using a scan tool. Refer to Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) .<br><br><br><b>Mist Operation</b><br><br>Windshield wiper/washer system MIST operation is identical to wiper Low operation, except that the mist switch is a press and release type switch. When the <a href="5735.html">wiper switch</a> is moved to the mist position and released, low speed <a href="5733.html">wiper motor</a> operation is started and will continue until 1 wipe cycle is complete. If the wiper switch is moved to the mist position and held, the wiper motor will operate in the low mode until the switch is released.<br><br><br><b>Delay Operation</b><br><br>Windshield wiper delay operation is a low speed <a href="5733.html">wiper motor</a> function with a variable delay interval between the wiper motor cycles. The delay interval is determined by a series of 6 resistors within the wiper/washer switch. The body control module (BCM) monitors the <a href="5735.html">wiper switch</a> low signal circuit to determine the delay interval between the low speed wiper motor wipe cycles.<br><br><br><b>High Speed Operation</b><br><br>When the <a href="5735.html">wiper switch</a> is in the high speed position, ground is applied through the windshield wiper switch high signal circuit to the body control module (BCM) indicating the wiper high speed request. In response to this signal, the BCM then energizes the WPR relay, as stated above, and the WPR HI relay by applying ground through the control circuit to the coil side of the relay. With the wiper high relay energized and its switch contacts closed to the high speed control circuit of the <a href="5733.html">wiper motor</a>, the motor will operate at high speed.<br><br><br>The wiper high speed relay can also be commanded ON/OFF by using a scan tool. However, before commanding the <a href="5733.html">wiper motor</a> high speed mode ON/OFF using a scan tool, the WPR relay must be energized by placing the <a href="5735.html">wiper switch</a> in the low speed position. Refer to Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) .<br><br><br><b>Wash Operation</b><br><br>When the windshield Wash switch is pressed, ground is applied through the switch contacts and the <a href="5729.html">windshield washer switch</a> signal circuit to the body control module (BCM) indicating the windshield wash request. The BCM then energizes the WPR relay, as stated above, and the WSH relay by applying ground through the control circuit to the coil side of the relay. With the wash relay energized, battery voltage from the WPR fuse is applied through the switch side of the relay and out to the control circuit of the windshield washer fluid pump. The <a href="5733.html">wiper motor</a> will operate for 2 wipe cycles after the wash switch is released.<br><br><br>The WSH relay can also be commanded ON/OFF by using a scan tool. Refer to Control Module References  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) .<br><br><br>The washer nozzles are heated to assist with washer fluid flow in cold temperatures. Ignition voltage is applied through the MIS IGN fuse in the underhood fuse block to the windshield washer nozzle control circuits. Both nozzles are grounded at G101.<br><br><br><b>Park Position Operation</b><br><br>Windshield wiper motor park operation is controlled by the body control module (BCM) using an input from the park switch that is located within the wiper motor assembly. The BCM monitors the windshield wiper motor park switch signal circuit, to determine if the windshield <a href="5731.html">wiper blades</a> are at the bottom of the glass. During wiper operation, each time the wiper blades are at the bottom of the glass, the park switch is momentarily closed to ground signaling the BCM the wiper position. When the <a href="5735.html">wiper switch</a> is turned to the OFF position while the <a href="5733.html">wiper motor</a> is somewhere in mid-cycle, the BCM will continue to operate the motor until the wipers reach the park position. If the ignition is turned OFF while the wipers are in mid-cycle, the wipers will stop immediately where they are. The BCM will park the wipers the next time the ignition is turned ON.<br><br><br><b>Washer Fluid LOW ADD FLUID Message</b><br><br>The WASHER FLUID LOW ADD FLUID message is controlled by the instrument panel cluster (IPC) using an input from the <a href="5723.html">washer fluid level switch</a>. With the ignition in the ON position, the IPC applies ignition voltage through an internal resistor and the windshield washer fluid level signal circuit to the windshield washer fluid level switch. The IPC then monitors this voltage to determine the washer fluid level. With the washer fluid above a determined level, the washer fluid level switch is open and the IPC detects voltage on the signal circuit. When the washer fluid reaches the point where the driver should be informed that the washer fluid is low, the washer fluid level switch closes. When the washer fluid level switch is closed, the washer fluid level signal circuit is pulled low and the IPC displays the WASHER FLUID LOW ADD FLUID message on the driver information center (DIC). In order to prevent the WASHER FLUID LOW ADD FLUID message from being displayed while sloshing is occurring in the washer fluid container, the IPC is programed with a 1 minute delay before changing states of the WASHER FLUID LOW ADD FLUID message during an ignition cycle.<br><br></div>
