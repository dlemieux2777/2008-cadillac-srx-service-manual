Significant additional mass can affect trim height and wheel alignment of the vehicle and may necessitate a customer pay wheel alignment when placed semi-permanently in the vehicle (Upfitter instructions are to realign the vehicle after placement of these types of items. (This typically applies to trucks and incomplete vehicles that can be upfit with equipment such as the above.) <br><br><b>Customer Concerns, "Normal Operation" Conditions and "Mileage Policy"</b><br><br><b>Possible Concerns</b><br><br>The following are typical conditions that may require wheel alignment warranty service: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Lead/Pull: </b> defined as "at a constant highway speed on a typical straight road, the amount of effort required at the steering wheel to maintain the vehicle's straight heading." <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Please evaluate for the condition with hands-on the steering wheel. Follow the "Vehicle Leads/Pulls" diagnostic tree located in SI to determine the cause of a lead/pull concern. Lead/Pull concerns can be due to road crown or road slope, <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>, wheel alignment or even in rare circumstances a steering gear issue. Lead/pull concerns due to road crown are considered "Normal Operation" and are NOT a warrantable condition -- the customer should be advised that this is "Normal Operation."</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Some customers may comment on a "Lead/Pull" when they hold the steering wheel in a level condition. If so, this is more likely a "steering wheel angle" concern because the customer is "steering" the vehicle to obtain a "level" steering wheel.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Steering wheel angle to the left or right </b> (counter-clockwise or clockwise, respectively): Defined as the steering wheel angle (clocking) deviation from "level" while maintaining a straight heading on a typical straight road. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Irregular or Premature tire wear: </b> Slight to very slight "feathering" or "edge" wear on the shoulders of <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> is NOT considered unusual and should even out with a tire rotation; if the customer is concerned about a "feathering" condition of the tires, the customer could be advised to rotate the tires earlier than the next scheduled mileage/<a href="0.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> interval (but no later than the next interval). Be sure to understand the customer's driving habits as this will also heavily influence the tire wear performance; tire wear from aggressive or abusive driving habits is NOT a warrantable condition.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Slight or mild feathering, cupping, edge or heel/toe wear of tire tread shoulders is "normal" and can show up very early in a tire/vehicle service mileage; in fact, some new <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> can show evidence of feathering from the factory. These issues do NOT affect the overall performance and tread life of the tire. Dealer personnel should always check the customer's <a href="0.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> records to ensure that tire inflation pressure is being maintained to placard and that the tires are being rotated (modified-X pattern) at the proper mileage intervals. Wheel alignments are NOT to be performed for the types of "Normal" Tire Feathering shown in Figures 1-4 below.</b><br><br><b>Figure 1: Full Tread View - "NORMAL" Tire "Feathering" Wear on the Shoulder/Adjacent/Center Ribs</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/123959640.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Figure 2: Tire Shoulder View Example 1 - "NORMAL" Tire "Feathering" Wear on the Shoulder</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/123987332.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Figure 3: Tire Shoulder View Example 2 - "NORMAL" Tire "Feathering" Wear</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/124065641.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Figure 4: Detail Side View of Tire Shoulder Area - "NORMAL" Tire "Feathering" Wear</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/124115458.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>When a wheel alignment is deemed necessary for tire wear, be sure to document on the repair order, in as much detail as possible, the severity and type of tire wear (e.g., severe center wear or severe inside or outside shoulder wear) and the position of the tire on the vehicle (RF, LF, LR, RR). Please note the customer's concern with the wear such as, noise, appearance, wear life, etc. A field product report with pictures of the tire wear condition is recommended.

Be sure to verify from the customer the types of roads they are driving as they may not recognize the influence of road crown on vehicle lead/pull and steering wheel angle. If a vehicle requires significant steering effort to prevent it from "climbing" the road crown there may be an issue to be looked into further.<br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>A wheel alignment will generally NOT correct vehicles that follow the road crown since this is within "Normal Operation." </b><br><br><b>Mileage Policy</b><br><br>The following mileage policy applies for E2020 and E2000 labor operations: <br><b>Note</b><br>Wheel Alignment is NOT covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Express and Savana Cutaway vehicles as these vehicles require Upfitters to set the wheel alignment after completing the vehicles.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>0-800 km (0-500 mi): </b> E2000/E2020 claims ONLY allowed with Call Center Authorization. Due to the tie down during shipping, the vehicle's suspension requires some time to reach normal operating position. For this reason, new vehicles are generally NOT to be aligned until they have accumulated at least 800 km (500 mi). A field product report should accompany any claim within this mileage range. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>801-12,000 km (501-7,500 mi): </b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If a vehicle came from the factory with incorrect alignment settings, any resulting off-angle steering wheel, lead/pull characteristics or the rare occurrence of excessive tire wear would be apparent early in the life of the vehicle.
