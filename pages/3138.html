<h1>Retained Accessory Power (RAP) Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Retained Accessory Power (RAP) Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Retained Accessory Power (RAP)</b><br><br>The BCM monitors the <a href="0.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Starting%20System/Ignition%20Switch/">ignition switch</a> position, battery condition, and each door ajar/open switch status to determine whether RAP should be initiated or terminated. RAP is controlled with 2 different methods; serial data and direct BCM control. Some modules receive a RAP message from the body control module (BCM) over the serial data circuits. Serial data controlled RAP is deactivated as required by their modules RAP power mode operation. Other subsystems are activated directly by the BCM. Components and systems that are active in RAP are also activated anytime the ignition is any position other than OFF regardless of the door switch signals.<br><br><br><b>BCM Controlled RAP</b><br><br>The BCM controlled RAP is a switch controlled voltage supply from the BCM. Power is provided for approximately 10 minutes after shutting the ignition OFF and removing the <a href="2852.html">key</a>, providing no door is opened. <br><br><br>BCM controlled RAP will end when one of the following conditions is met:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM receives an input from any door ajar or open switch indicating the opening of any door after the ignition <a href="2852.html">key</a> is out of the ignition. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>If the BCM is receiving any door ajar or open signal from those switches when the ignition <a href="2852.html">key</a> is turned OFF, RAP will not initiate.</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM internal timer for the RAP expires after approximately 10 minutes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM detects a decrease in battery capacity below a prescribed limit.<br><br><br>Systems powered by the BCM during retained accessory power (RAP) power mode are as follows:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Sunroof control module<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rear Sunshade control module<br><br><br><br><b>Serial Data Controlled RAP</b><br><br>RAP systems controlled by serial data are as follows:<br><br><b>Radio</b><br><br>Radio RAP activation/termination is the same as BCM controlled operation with 1 exception; the only door switch that will turn off the radio during RAP is the driver door open switch.<br><br><b>Vehicle Communication Interface Module (VCIM) (Onstar(R))</b><br><br>VCIM RAP activation/termination is the same as radio operation with 1 exception; if there is an active call when the ignition <a href="2852.html">key</a> is turned off the VCIM will remain in RAP mode, and keep the radio in RAP mode until the call is terminated.<br><br></div>
