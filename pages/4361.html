<h1>OnStar Reconfiguration (without TIS2web Gen 3 and prior)</h1><br><br><b>OnStar Reconfiguration (without TIS2web Gen 3 and prior)</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>The vehicle communication interface module (VCIM) has a specific set of unique numbers that tie the module to a specific vehicle. These numbers, the 10-digit station identification and 11-digit electronic serial number (ESN) , are used by the National Cellular Network and OnStar(R) to identify the specific vehicle. Because these numbers are tied to the vehicle identification number of the vehicle, these parts should NOT be exchanged with those of another vehicle. After replacing the VCIM, it is essential to reconfigure the OnStar(R) system. Failure to reconfigure the system will result in an additional customer visit for repair. In addition, pressing and holding the white dot button on the keypad will not reset this version of the OnStar(R) system. This action will cause a DTC to set.</b><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the scan tool.
