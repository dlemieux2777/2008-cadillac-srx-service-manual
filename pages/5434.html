The lower bulb in the <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> is the high beam and the upper bulb is the low beam. <br><br><br>The headlamps may be turned ON in 3 different ways:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the <a>headlamp switch</a> is placed in the ON position, for normal operation<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the <a>headlamp switch</a> is placed in the AUTO position, for automatic lamp control (ALC)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the <a>headlamp switch</a> is placed in the AUTO position, with the windshield wipers ON in daylight conditions, after a 6 second delay<br><br><br>Battery voltage is applied at all times to the coil and switched side of the <a>low beam relay</a>. Ground is applied at all times from G201 to the turn signal/multifunction switch. When the turn signal/multifunction switch is placed in the HEAD position, ground is applied from the turn signal/multifunction switch through the headlamps ON signal circuit to the body control module (BCM). The BCM applies ground to the <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> low beam relay control circuit. This energizes the low beam relay, closing the switched side and applies battery voltage to the LEFT and RIGHT LOW BEAM fuses. Battery voltage is then applied from the fuses, through the low beam voltage supply circuits to the left and right low beam headlamp assemblies illuminating the low beam headlamps. Ground for the left headlamp is provided at G101 and the right headlamp at G102.<br><br><br><b>High Intensity Discharge (HID) Low Beam Headlamps (uplevel)</b><br><br>Battery voltage is applied at all times to the coil and switched side of the <a>low beam relay</a>. Ground is applied at all times from G201 to the turn signal/multifunction switch. When the turn signal/multifunction switch is placed in the HEAD position, ground is applied from the turn signal/multifunction switch through the headlamps ON signal circuit to the body control module (BCM). The BCM applies ground to the <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> low beam relay control circuit. This energizes the low beam relay, closing the switched side and applies battery voltage to the LEFT and RIGHT LOW BEAM fuses. Battery voltage is then applied from the fuses, through the low beam voltage supply circuits to the left and right headlamp ballast located in each headlamp assembly. When battery voltage is applied to the headlamp ballast through the low beam voltage supply circuits, the ballast charge the starter to start the lamp. High intensity discharge (HID) headlamps do not have filaments like traditional bulbs, instead the starter uses a high voltage transformer to convert the input voltage into a higher voltage. This increased voltage is used in order to create an arc between the electrodes in the bulb. Ground for the left headlamp is provided at G101 and the right headlamp at G102.<br><br><b>Run Up Of The Lamp</b><br><br>Each ballast requires higher amperage in order to ensure normal startup and run up of the lamp. Run up is the term used to describe the extra power level given to the bulb. The input current during the steady state operation is lower that the start up amperage. After the lamp receives the strike from the starter and the arc is established, the ballast uses its operating voltage in order to provide the run up power needed in order to keep the lamp on. The lamp rapidly increases in intensity from a dim glow to a very high-intensity, bright light called a steady state. Within a few seconds of the arc being established in the bulb, the majority of steady state is complete. 100 percent of the steady state is completed shortly there after. A high watt power level is necessary in order to bring the lamp to a steady state in such a short period of time. The high watt power level allows the lamp to meet the SAE light vs. time specification.<br><br><b>When To Change The HID Bulb</b><br><br>Bulb failure, end of life occurs when the bulb gets old and becomes unstable. The bulb may begin shutting itself off sporadically and unpredictably at first, perhaps only once during a 24-hour period. When the bulb begins shutting itself off occasionally, the ballast will automatically turn the bulb back on again within 0.5 seconds. The ballast will re-strike the bulb so quickly that the bulb may not appear to have shut off. As the bulb ages, the bulb may begin to shut off more frequently, eventually over 30 times per minute. When the bulb begins to shut off more frequently, the ballast receives excessive, repetitive current input . Repetitive and excessive restarts or re-strikes, without time for the ballast to cool down, will permanently damage the ballast. As a safeguard, when repetitive re-strikes are detected, the ballast will not attempt to re-strike the lamp. The ballast then shuts down and the bulb goes out.<br><br>The following symptoms are noticeable signs of bulb failure:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Flickering light, caused in the early stages of bulb failure<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lights go out, caused when the ballast detects excessive, repetitive bulb re-strike<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Color change-The lamp may change to a dim pink glow.<br><br><br>Input power to the ballast must be terminated in order to reset the ballast's fault circuitry. In order to terminate the input power to the ballast, turn the lights off and back on again. Turning the lights off and back on again resets all of the fault circuitry within the ballast until the next occurrence of excessive, repetitive bulb re-strikes. When excessive, repetitive bulb re-strikes occur, replace the starter/arc tube assembly. The ballast will begin the start-up process when the starter/arc tube assembly is replaced. Repeatedly resetting the input power can overheat the internal components and cause permanent damage to the ballast. Allow a few minutes of cool-down time in between reset attempts.<br><br><br>Bulb failures are often sporadic at first, and difficult to repeat. Technicians can identify bulb failure by observing if the problem gets progressively worse over the next 100 hours of operation.<br><br><b>Light Color</b><br><br>White light has a different color rating than regular headlamps. The range of white light that is acceptable is broad when compared to halogens. Therefore, some variation in headlight coloring between the right and left <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> will be normal. One high intensity discharge (HID) at the end of the normal range may appear considerably different in color from one at the other end of the range. Difference in color is normal. Replace the arc tube only if the arc tube is determined to be at the bulb failure stage.<br><br><br><b>Automatic Lamp Control/Twilight Sentinel</b><br><br>Place the turn signal/multifunction switch in the AUTO position for automatic lamp control. During automatic lamp control the headlamps will be off during daylight conditions but will turn on when the <a href="103.html">ambient light sensor</a> detects low outside light level. The ambient light sensor is a light sensitive transistor that varies the voltage signal to the HVAC control module. The HVAC control module sends a signal to the body control module (BCM) via GMLAN serial data commanding the BCM to apply ground to the <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> <a>low beam relay</a> control circuit. This energizes the low beam relay, closing the switched side and applies battery voltage to the LEFT and RIGHT LOW BEAM fuses. Battery voltage is applied from the low beam fuses, through the low beam voltage supply circuits to low headlamp assemblies.<br><br><br><b>Flash to Pass (FTP)</b><br><br>When the low beam headlamps are on and the turn signal/multifunction switch is momentarily placed in the flash to pass (FTP) position, ground is applied from G201 to the turn signal/multifunction switch. The turn signal/multifunction switch applies ground to the body control module (BCM) through the FTP switch signal circuit. The BCM then applies ground to the <a>high beam relay</a> control circuit. This energizes the high beam relay, closing the switched side of the high beam relay, applying battery voltage to the LEFT and RIGHT HIGH BEAM fuses. Battery voltage is applied from the High Beam fuses through the high beam voltage supply circuit to the high beam <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> assemblies. This causes the high beam headlamps to illuminate at full brightness momentarily.<br><br><br><b>Automatic <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> Leveling - Export Only</b><br><br>The Automatic <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> Leveling Systems consist of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ballast module - left<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ballast module - right<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> leveling actuator - left<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> leveling actuator - right<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> leveling controller - left<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> leveling controller - right<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> leveling sensor - front<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">Headlamp</a> leveling sensor - rear<br><br><br>The automatic <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> leveling system automatically maintains the vertical alignment of the headlamps when the vehicle load and driving conditions change. The right and left headlamp leveling controllers share the inputs from the front and rear headlamp leveling sensors to determine vehicle pitch. The headlamp leveling sensors send an output to the headlamp leveling controllers as the vehicle suspension compresses and rebounds. The controllers calculate the difference in vehicle pitch and send a command to the high intensity discharge (HID) ballast. The ballast then drive the headlamp leveling actuators to the position commanded by the controllers. The headlamp leveling system also monitors the performance of the HID bulb and ballast. When the <a>headlamp switch</a> is placed in the ON position the headlamps will go down, and then back up to the center position.<br><br><br><b>Daytime Running Lamps (DRL)</b><br><br>The daytime running lamps (DRL) will illuminate the right and left front <a>turn signal bulbs</a> continuously. The DRLs will operate when the following conditions are met:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is in the RUN or CRANK position<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The shift lever is out of the PARK position for vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions or the parking brake is released for vehicles with manual transmissions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The high and low beam headlamps are OFF.<br><br><br>The <a href="103.html">ambient light sensor</a> is used to monitor outside lighting conditions. The ambient light sensor provides a voltage signal that will vary between 0.2 and 4.9 volts depending on outside lighting conditions. The HVAC control module provides a low reference ground and a 5-volt reference signal to the ambient light sensor. The HVAC control module monitors the ambient light sensor signal circuit to determine if outside lighting conditions are correct for either daytime running lights (DRL) or automatic lamp control (ALC) when the <a>headlamp switch</a> is in the AUTO position. The HVAC control module sends a signal to the body control module (BCM) via GMLAN serial data commanding the BCM to turn the front turn lamps on steady (non-flashing). Any function or condition that turns on the headlamps will cancel the DRL operation. With the turn signal/multifunction switch in the OFF position, the turn signal lamps will either be turned ON or OFF after a 30-second delay, depending on whether daylight or low light conditions are sensed by the ambient light sensor.<br><br><br><b>Front Fog Lamps</b><br><br>Ground is applied at all times at G201 to the front fog lamp switch inside of the turn signal/multifunction switch. When the front fog lamp switch is placed in the ON position, ground is applied through the front fog lamp switch signal circuit to the body control module (BCM). The body control module (BCM) energizes the front fog lamp relay by applying ground to the front fog lamp relay control circuit. When the front fog lamp relay is energized, the relay switch contacts close and battery voltage is applied through the FRONT FOG LAMP fuse to the front fog lamp supply voltage circuit which illuminates the front fog lamps. Ground for the front fog lamps is applied at all times at G101 for the left fog lamp and G102 for the right fog lamp. G102 also serves as ground for the coil side of the FRT FOG LP relay.<br><br><br>The BCM will send a message GMLAN serial data to the instrument panel cluster (IPC) to enable the front fog lamp indicator. The front fog lamps will deactivate when either the flash-to-pass or the high beam headlamps are turned ON.<br><br><br><b>Rear Fog Lamps</b><br><br>Ground is applied at all times at G201 to the rear fog lamp switch inside of the turn signal/multifunction switch. When the rear fog lamp switch is placed in the ON position, ground is applied through the rear fog lamp switch signal circuit to the body control module (BCM). Battery voltage is applied at all times from the REAR FOG LAMP fuse to the REAR FOG LAMP relay. The BCM applies ground through the rear fog lamp relay control circuit to the coil side of the REAR FOG LAMP relay causing the relay to energize. When the relay is energized, the switch contacts close and battery voltage is applied from the REAR FOG LAMP fuse through the relay, to the rear fog lamps. Ground for the rear fog lamps is applied at all times at G302.<br><br><br>The BCM will send a message via GMLAN serial data to the instrument panel cluster (IPC) to enable the rear fog lamp indicator.<br><br><br><b>Park, Tail, License and <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Marker%20Lamp/">Marker Lamps</a></b><br><br>The rear tail, stop, and turn signal functions are performed by light emitting diodes (LED) in the <a href="5427.html">tail lamp</a> assemblies. The tail lamp assemblies wrap around the corner of the vehicle and serve as the rear side marker. The lower portion of each lamp contains reflectors to alert approaching vehicles for nighttime driving safety. The front park and side marker lamps are part of the front headlamp assembly and use an incandescent bulb. The park, tail, license and <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Marker%20Lamp/">marker lamps</a> are turned on when the <a>headlamp switch</a> is placed in the PARK LAMP or <a href="0.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">HEADLAMP</a> position or anytime the headlights are requested. The park lamps are also turned on with the front fog lamps. Battery voltage is applied at all times to both coil and switched sides of the PARK LAMP relay located in the left rear fuse block. Ground is applied at G201 to the turn signal/multifunction switch at all times. When the headlamp switch is place in either the HEAD or PARK position, ground is applied to the park lamp relay control circuit. This energizes the PARK LAMP Relay and applies battery voltage to all park, tail, license, and marker lamps. Ground for the front park and marker lamps is supplied at G101 for the left and G102 for the right. Ground for the license, tail, and rear side marker lamps is supplied at G302.<br><br><br><b>Turn Signal Lamps</b><br><br>Ground is applied at all times at G201 to the turn signal/multifunction switch. The turn signal lamps may only be activated with the ignition switch in the ON or START position. When the turn signal/multifunction switch is placed in either the TURN RIGHT or TURN LEFT position, ground is applied to the body control module (BCM) through either the right turn or left <a href="108.html">turn signal switch</a> circuit. Battery voltage is applied at all times to the BCM. The BCM then applies a pulsating voltage to the front and rear turn signal lamps. Ground for the left front <a href="5430.html">turn signal lamp</a> is supplied at G101. Ground for the right front turn signal lamp is supplied at G102. The left and right rear turn signal lamps are supplied ground at G302.<br><br><br><b>Repeater Lamps</b><br><br>The repeater lamps are on export vehicles only. Each lamp is located in the front fender. The repeater lamps are used as additional turn signal lamps, and operate as described in the Turn Signal/Hazard Flasher Lamps description. The repeater lamps have ground at G104.<br><br><br><b>Hazard Flasher Lamps</b><br><br>The hazard flashers may be activated in any power mode. The hazard switch is permanently grounded through G201. When the hazard switch is placed in the ON position, ground is applied through the hazard switch signal circuit to the body control module (BCM). The BCM supplies battery voltage to all four turn signal lamps in an ON and OFF duty cycle. When the hazard switch is placed in the ON position, the instrument panel cluster (IPC) receives a signal from the hazard switch and applies voltage through the hazard flash indicator circuit to the hazard switch to illuminate the hazard indicator.<br><br><br><b>Stop Lamps</b><br><br><b>Domestic</b><br><br>The brake pedal position sensor is used to sense the action of the driver application of the brake pedal. The brake pedal position sensor provides an analog voltage signal that will increase as the brake pedal is applied. The body control module (BCM) provides a low reference signal and a 5-volt reference voltage to the brake pedal position sensor. When the variable signal reaches a voltage threshold indicating the brakes have been applied, the BCM will apply battery voltage to the right and left stop lamp control circuits, transmission control module (TCM), engine control module (ECM), and center high mounted stop lamp (CHMSL) control circuit. Ground for the stop lamps and CHMSL is applied at G302. The stop lamps on this vehicle will not illuminate unless the ignition is in the accessory, run, or crank positions. When the ignition is in the OFF position the stop lamps will not illuminate when the brake pedal is applied.<br><br><b>Export</b><br><br>The brake pedal position sensor is used to sense the action of the driver application of the brake pedal. The brake pedal position sensor provides an analog voltage signal that will increase as the brake pedal is applied. The body control module (BCM) provides a low reference signal and a 5-volt reference voltage to the brake pedal position sensor. When the variable signal reaches a voltage threshold indicating the brakes have been applied, the BCM will apply battery voltage to stop lamp relay coil side control circuit, transmission control module (TCM), engine control module (ECM), and center high mounted stop lamp (CHMSL). When the stop lamp relay receives battery voltage from the BCM, the relay coil is energized and the stop lamp relay switch contacts close applying battery voltage from the STOP LAMPS fuse to illuminate the rear stop lamps, center high mounted stop lamp (CHMSL), and trailer stop lamps. Ground for the stop lamps and CHMSL is applied at G302. The stop lamps on this vehicle will not illuminate unless the ignition is in the accessory, run, or crank positions. When the ignition is in the OFF position the stop lamps will not illuminate when the brake pedal is applied.<br><br><br><b><a href="5303.html">Backup Lamps</a></b><br><br>When the transmission is placed in the REVERSE position, the transmission control module (TCM) sends a GMLAN serial data message to the body control module (BCM). The message indicates that the gear selector is in the REVERSE position. The BCM applies battery voltage to the <a href="5303.html">backup lamp</a> control circuit to the left rear fuse block. The left rear fuse block distributes the battery voltage to the backup lamps and inside rearview mirror. The backup lamps are permanently grounded at G302. Once the driver moves the gear selector out of the REVERSE position, a message is sent by the TCM via GMLAN serial data requesting the BCM to remove battery voltage from the backup lamp control circuit.<br><br><br><b>Battery Run Down Protection/Inadvertent Power</b><br><br>To provide battery run down protection, the exterior lamps will be deactivated automatically under certain conditions. The body control module (BCM) monitors the state of the <a>headlamp switch</a>. If the park or headlamp switch is ON when the ignition switch is placed in either the CRANK or RUN position and then placed in the OFF position, the BCM initiates a 10 minute timer. At the end of the 10 minutes, the BCM will turn off the control power output to the park and <a href="30.html">headlamp relay</a> coils, deactivating the exterior lamps. This feature will be cancelled if any power mode other than OFF becomes active. The BCM will disable battery run down protection if any of the following conditions exist. The park or headlamp switch is placed in the ON to OFF position, and back to the ON position during battery run down protection. The BCM determined that the park or headlamp switch was not active when the ignition was turned OFF.<br><br></div>
