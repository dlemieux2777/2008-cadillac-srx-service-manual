<h1>Body Control Systems: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Body Control System Description and Operation</b><br><br>The body control system consists of the body control module (BCM), communications, and various input and outputs. Some inputs, outputs and messages require other modules to interact with the <a href="34.html">BCM</a>. The BCM also has discrete input and output terminals to control the vehicle's body functions. Battery positive voltage is provided to the BCM from the BCM fuse in the underhood fuse block. The module has two grounds at G 202 as well as one directly to the vehicle battery. The BCM is wired to the GMLAN High speed serial data buss and the GMLAN Low speed serial data buss and acts as a gateway between them. If the BCM does not communicate the vehicle will not start due to the inability of the engine/powertrain control module (ECM/PCM) and vehicle theft deterrent (VTD) control module to communicate without the BCM providing the gateway function. <br><br><br><b>Power Mode Master</b><br><br>This vehicle body control module (BCM) functions as the power mode master (PMM). The ignition switch is a low current switch with multiple discrete ignition switch signals to the PMM for determination the power mode that will be sent over the serial data circuits to the other modules that need this information, and so the PMM will activate relays and other direct outputs of the PMM as needed. Refer to Power Mode Description and Operation  (<a href="2934.html">Power Mode Description and Operation</a>) for a complete description of power mode functions.<br><br><br><b>Gateway</b><br><br>The body control module (BCM) in this vehicle functions as a gateway or translator. The purpose of the gateway is to translate serial data messages between the GMLAN high speed buss and the GMLAN low speed buss for communication between the various modules. The gateway will interact with each network according to that network's transmission protocol. <br><br><br>One example of this necessary communication is the communication between the engine/powertrain control module (ECM/PCM) which is high speed serial data and vehicle theft deterrent (VTD) control module which is low speed serial data. If these modules can not exchange information, the vehicle will not start.<br><br><br>All communication between the <a href="34.html">BCM</a> and a scan tool is on the High speed GMLAN serial data circuits. A lost communication DTC typically is set in modules other than the module with a communication failure.<br><br><br><b>Body Control</b><br><br>The various body control module (BCM) input and output circuits are described in the corresponding functional areas indicated on the <a href="34.html">BCM</a> electrical schematics.
