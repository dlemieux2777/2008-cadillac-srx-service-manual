Using the proper tools, flush and bleed the PS system. Any residual contaminants will result in pump failure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When removing the pulley, use the proper special tools. Because the pulley alignment is critical, distorting the pulley may damage bearings on the new PS pump.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Note</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Some new PS pumps may not include a new O-ring. Please refer to the appropriate Parts Catalog. Saturn retailers should refer to the appropriate model year Parts & Illustration Catalog for the vehicle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Be sure to use only the new O-rings included with the PS pump. The new reservoir O-ring must be lubricated with OE-specific PS fluid prior to installation. Also make sure that the control valve O-ring is in its exact groove position and is NOT covering the pressure bypass hole.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Bleed the PS system according to the procedures/recommendations in SI.<br><br>Following these procedures and using the correct tools and fluids should help ensure that the new PS pump operates properly. Skipping steps may cost you time and trouble later.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
