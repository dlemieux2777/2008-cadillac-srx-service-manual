<h1>Use of Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) and Anaerobic Sealant</h1><br><br><b>Use of Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) and Anaerobic Sealant</b><br><br><b>Sealant Types</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>The correct sealant and amount of sealant must be used in the proper location to prevent oil leaks, coolant leaks, or the loosening of the fasteners. DO NOT interchange the sealants. Use only the sealant, or equivalent, as specified in the service procedure.</b><br><br><br><br>The following 2 major types of sealant are commonly used in engines:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Anaerobic sealant room temperature vulcanizing (RTV)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Anaerobic sealant, which include the following:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Gasket eliminator<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Pipe<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Threadlock<br><br><br><br><br><b>Anaerobic Type Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) Sealant</b><br><br>Anaerobic type room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) sealant cures in the absence of air. This type of sealant is used where 2 components, such as the <a href="513.html">intake manifold</a> and the engine block, are assembled together.<br><br><br>Use the following information when using RTV sealant:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not use RTV sealant in areas where extreme temperatures are expected. These areas include: <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The <a href="844.html">exhaust manifold</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The head gasket<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Any other surfaces where a different type of sealant is specified in the service procedure<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always follow all the safety recommendations and the directions that are on the RTV sealant container.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use a plastic or wood scraper in order to remove all the RTV sealant from the components.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b>  Do not allow the RTV sealant to enter any blind threaded hole. RTV sealant that is allowed to enter a blind threaded hole can cause hydraulic lock of the fastener when the fastener is tightened. Hydraulic lock of a fastener can lead to damage to the fastener and/or the components. Hydraulic lock of a fastener can also prevent the proper clamping loads to be obtained when the fastener is tightened. Improper clamping loads can prevent proper sealing of the components allowing leakage to occur. Preventing proper fastener tightening can allow the components to loosen or separate leading to extensive engine damage.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The surfaces to be sealed must be clean and dry.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use a RTV sealant bead size as specified in the service procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply the RTV sealant bead to the inside of any bolt holes areas.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>Do not wait for the RTV sealant to skin over.</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Assemble the components while the RTV sealant is still wet to the touch, within 3 minutes. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>Do not overtighten the fasteners.</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tighten the fasteners in sequence, if specified, and to the proper torque specifications.<br><br><br><br><b>Anaerobic Type Gasket Eliminator Sealant</b><br><br>Anaerobic type gasket eliminator sealant cures in the absence of air. This type of sealant is used where 2 rigid parts, such as castings, are assembled together. When 2 rigid parts are disassembled and no sealant or gasket is readily noticeable, then the 2 parts were probably assembled using an anaerobic type gasket eliminator sealant.<br><br><br>Use the following information when using gasket eliminator sealant:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always follow all the safety recommendations and directions that are on the gasket eliminator sealant container.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply a continuous bead of gasket eliminator sealant to one flange. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The surfaces to be sealed must be clean and dry.<br><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Do not allow the sealant to enter a blind hole. The sealant may prevent the fastener from achieving proper clamp load, cause component damage when the fastener is tightened, or lead to component failure.<br><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Gasket eliminator sealed joint fasteners that are partially torqued and the gasket eliminator sealant allowed to cure more than 5 minutes, may result in incorrect shimming and sealing of the joint.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Do not overtighten the fasteners.</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Apply the gasket eliminator sealant evenly to get a uniform thickness of the gasket eliminator sealant on the sealing surface.</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Tighten the fasteners in sequence, if specified, and to the proper torque specifications. </b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>After properly tightening the fasteners, remove the excess gasket eliminator sealant from the outside of the joint.</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Anaerobic Type Threadlock Sealant</b><br><br>Anaerobic type threadlock sealant cures in the absence of air. This type of sealant is used for threadlocking and sealing of bolts, fittings, nuts, and studs. This type of sealant cures only when confined between 2 close fitting metal surfaces.<br><br><br>Use the following information when using threadlock sealant:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always follow all safety recommendations and directions that are on the threadlock sealant container.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The threaded surfaces to be sealed must be clean and dry.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply the threadlock sealant as specified on the threadlock sealant container.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Fasteners that are partially torqued and then the threadlock sealant allowed to cure more than 5 minutes, may result in incorrect clamp load of assembled components.</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Do not overtighten the fasteners.</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tighten the fasteners in sequence, if specified, and to the proper torque specifications. <br><br><br><br><b>Anaerobic Type Pipe Sealant</b><br><br>Anaerobic type pipe sealant cures in the absence of air and remains pliable when cured. This type of sealant is used where 2 parts are assembled together and require a leak proof joint.<br><br><br>Use the following information when using pipe sealant:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not use pipe sealant in areas where extreme temperatures are expected.
