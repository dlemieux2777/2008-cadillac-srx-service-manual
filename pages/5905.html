<h1>Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancing - On-Vehicle</h1><br><br><b>Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancing - On-Vehicle</b><br><br><b>Tools Required</b><br><br>J 38792-A Electronic Vibration Analyzer (EVA) 2<br><br>If after following the tire and wheel vibration diagnostic process, some amount of tire and wheel vibration is still evident, an on-vehicle high-speed spin balancer may be used to perform an on-vehicle balance in an attempt to finish balance the tire and wheel assemblies, <a href="0.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Drive%20Axles%2C%20Bearings%20and%20Joints/Wheel%20Hub/">wheel hubs</a>, brake rotors, <a>brake drums</a>, if equipped, and wheel trim, if equipped, simultaneously. On-vehicle balancing can also compensate for minor amounts of residual runout encountered as a result of mounting the tire and wheel assembly on the vehicle, as opposed to the balance which was achieved on the off-vehicle balancer.<br><br><br>In order to perform an on-vehicle balancing procedure, carefully follow the on-vehicle balancer manufacturer's specific operating instructions and carefully consider the following information before proceeding:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicles equipped with low profile, wide tread path, high performance <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> and <a href="3624.html">wheels</a> are susceptible to small amounts of dynamic imbalance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When performing an on-vehicle balance, great care must be taken when placing the wheel balance weights on the <a href="3624.html">wheels</a>. If the wheel balance weights are not placed accurately, they can actually induce dynamic imbalance and thus increase the severity of the vibration.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the vehicle <a href="2257.html">wheel bearings</a> to ensure that they are in good condition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Thoroughly inspect all on-vehicle balancing equipment and ensure that it is fully within the manufacturer's recommended specifications.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not remove the off-vehicle balance weights. The purpose of on-vehicle balance is to fine tune the assembly balance already achieved off-vehicle, not to start over.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Leave all wheel trim installed whenever possible.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the on-vehicle balancer calls for more than 56 g (2 oz) of additional weight, split the weight between the inboard and outboard flanges of the wheel, so as not to upset the dynamic balance of the assembly achieved in the off-vehicle balance. For wheel balance weight information, refer to Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancing - Off Vehicle  (<a href="5124.html">Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancing - Off Vehicle</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If available, tape-off an area on top of the fenders and the quarter panels, then place the vibration sensor of the J 38792-A  on the <a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Fender/">fender</a> or quarter panel above the specific tire and wheel assembly while it is being on-vehicle balanced.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The J 38792-A  will provide a visual indication of the amplitude of the vibration, and the effect that the on-vehicle balance has on it.<br><br><br></div>
