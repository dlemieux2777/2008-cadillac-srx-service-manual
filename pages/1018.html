<h1>Electronic Ignition (EI) System Description</h1><br><br><b>Electronic Ignition (EI) System Description</b><br><br><b>Electronic Ignition (EI) System Operation</b><br><br>The electronic ignition (EI) system produces and controls the high energy secondary spark. This spark ignites the compressed air/fuel mixture at precisely the correct time, providing optimal performance, fuel economy, and control of exhaust emissions. The engine control module (ECM) primarily collects information from the crankshaft position (CKP) and camshaft position (CMP) sensors to control the sequence, dwell, and timing of the spark.<br><br><br><b> Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor</b><br><br>The crankshaft position (CKP) sensor circuits consist of an engine control module (ECM) supplied 5-volt reference circuit, low reference circuit and an output signal circuit. The CKP sensor is an internally magnetic biased digital output integrated circuit sensing device. The sensor detects magnetic flux changes of the teeth and slots of a 58-tooth reluctor wheel on the crankshaft. Each tooth on the reluctor wheel is spaced at 60-tooth spacing, with 2 missing teeth for the reference gap. The CKP sensor produces an ON/OFF DC voltage of varying frequency, with 58 output pulses per crankshaft revolution. The frequency of the CKP sensor output depends on the velocity of the crankshaft. The CKP sensor sends a digital signal, which represents an image of the crankshaft reluctor wheel, to the ECM as each tooth on the wheel rotates past the CKP sensor. The ECM uses each CKP signal pulse to determine crankshaft speed and decodes the crankshaft reluctor wheel reference gap to identify crankshaft position. This information is then used to determine the optimum ignition and injection points of the engine. The ECM also uses CKP sensor output information to determine the camshaft relative position to the crankshaft, to control camshaft phasing, and to detect cylinder misfire.<br><br><br><b>Crankshaft Reluctor Wheel</b><br><br>The crankshaft reluctor wheel is part of the crankshaft. The reluctor wheel contains a pattern around the circumference of the wheel consisting of 58 teeth and a reference gap. Each tooth on the reluctor wheel is spaced at 60 tooth spacing, or 6 degrees apart from each other with 2 missing teeth for the reference gap. The engine control module (ECM) uses the teeth and reference gap to determine the crankshaft position (CKP) and speed.<br><br><br><b>Camshaft Position (CMP) Sensor</b><br><br>Each camshaft position (CMP) sensor is a 3-wire sensor that provides a digital output signal. The wire circuits consist of an engine control module (ECM) supplied 5-volt reference circuit, a low reference circuit between the CMP sensor and the ECM, and an output signal circuit from the CMP sensor to the ECM. The CMP sensor detects magnetic flux changes between the teeth and slots on the reluctor wheel. The CMP sensor provides a digital ON/OFF DC voltage of varying frequency width output pulses per each camshaft revolution. The frequency of the CMP sensor output signal depends on the speed of the camshaft. The ECM will recognize the narrow and wide tooth patterns to identify camshaft position, or which cylinder is in compression and which is in exhaust. The information is then used to determine the correct time and sequence for fuel injection and ignition spark events. The ECM also uses the CMP sensor output signal to determine the camshaft relative position to the crankshaft position.<br><br><br><b>Camshaft Reluctor Wheel</b><br><br>The CMP sensors are used by the ECM to monitor the position of the camshafts. The intake cam sensor wheels have 4X targets. The exhaust cam sensor wheels have a 4X target. The ECM can detect a camshaft position variance as small as 4 degrees. The variance is the difference between the actual camshaft position and the desired camshaft position.<br><br><br><b>Knock Sensor (KS)</b><br><br>The knock sensor (KS) system enables the control module to control the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Ignition%20Timing/">ignition timing</a> for the best possible performance while protecting the engine from potentially damaging levels of detonation. The control module uses the <a href="197.html">KS</a> system to test for abnormal engine noise that may indicate detonation, also known as spark knock.<br><br><br>The <a href="197.html">KS</a> system uses 2 flat response 2-wire sensors. The sensor uses piezo-electric crystal technology that produces an AC voltage signal of varying amplitude and frequency based on the engine vibration or noise level. The amplitude and frequency are dependant upon the level of knock that the KS detects. The control module receives the KS signal through the signal circuit.<br><br><br>The control module learns a minimum noise level, or background noise, at idle from the <a href="197.html">KS</a> and uses calibrated values for the rest of the RPM range. The control module uses the minimum noise level to calculate a noise channel. A normal KS signal will ride within the noise channel. As engine speed and load change, the noise channel upper and lower parameters will change to accommodate the normal KS signal, keeping the signal within the channel. In order to determine which cylinders are knocking, the control module only uses KS signal information when each cylinder is near top dead center (TDC) of the firing stroke. If knock is present, the signal will range outside of the noise channel.<br><br><br>If the control module has determined that knock is present, it will retard the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Ignition%20Timing/">ignition timing</a> to attempt to eliminate the knock. The control module will always try to work back to a zero compensation level, or no spark retard. An abnormal <a href="197.html">KS</a> signal will stay outside of the noise channel or will not be present. KS diagnostics are calibrated to detect faults with the KS circuitry inside the control module, the KS wiring, or the KS voltage output. Some diagnostics are also calibrated to detect constant noise from an outside influence such as a loose/damaged component or excessive engine mechanical noise.<br><br><br><b> <a href="1387.html">Ignition Coils</a></b><br><br>Each <a href="1387.html">ignition coil</a> has an ignition 1 voltage feed and a ground circuit. The engine control module (ECM) supplies a low reference and an ignition control (IC) circuit. Each ignition coil contains a solid state driver module. The ECM will command the IC circuit ON, which allows the current to flow through the primary coil windings for the appropriate time or dwell. When the ECM commands the IC circuit OFF, this will interrupt current flow through the primary coil windings. The magnetic field created by the primary coil windings will collapse across the secondary coil windings, which induces a high voltage across the <a href="969.html">spark plug</a> electrodes. The primary coils are current limited to prevent overloading if the IC circuit is held ON for an extended time. <br><br><br><b> Engine Control Module (ECM)</b><br><br>The engine control module (ECM) controls all <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Ignition%20System/">ignition system</a> functions, and constantly corrects the basic spark timing. The ECM monitors information from various sensor inputs that include the following:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The throttle actuator control (TAC) system<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The mass airflow (MAF) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The intake air temperature (IAT) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed sensor (VSS)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The transmission gear position or range information sensors<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine knock sensor (KS)<br><br><br></div>
