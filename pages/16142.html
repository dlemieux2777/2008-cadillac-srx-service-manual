<h1>Restraints - Usage of Used/Salvaged/Imitation Components</h1>INFORMATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 08-09-41-003<br><br>Date: February 25, 2008<br><br>Subject: <br>General Motors Position Statement on Installation of Used Salvaged or Imitation Air Bag System Components<br><br>Models:<br>2008 and Prior GM Cars and Light Duty Trucks (Including Saturn and Saab)<br>2008 and Prior HUMMER H2, H3<br><br>Due to the critical nature of the design of Supplemental Inflatable Restraint Systems (SIR) (also known as <a href="0.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/">air bag systems</a>) GM does not support the use of any used salvage or imitation parts for repair. Only new genuine GM warranted parts should be used in repair.<br><br>Proper operation of the air bag system requires that any repairs to the vehicle be made with new GM warranted parts. Never use <a href="0.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/Air%20Bag/">air bag</a> parts from another vehicle or source. The reasons for this policy and practice within GM include the following:<br><br>Occupant Protection<br><br>Air bag system components are carefully developed and specifically tuned for the specific vehicle environment. Corresponding air bag system components from other models or other model years may appear similar from the outside and may even fit the vehicle but different internal elements or calibrations may result in degraded restraint performance.<br><br>Regulatory Compliance<br><br>All new GM vehicles are designed and built to meet or exceed all applicable Canadian and U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Use of air bag system components other than those specified could result in degraded restraint performance and under some circumstances could render the system inoperative. A repair establishment that knowingly makes a regulated safety system inoperative violates the Safety Act and becomes liable accordingly. The repair establishment also risks liability for losses or damage resulting from the repair.<br><br>Reliability<br><br>Reuse of used or salvaged components brings into question the conditions under which the components were obtained and stored prior to use. <br><br>Components could have been damaged or stored under unfavorable conditions that could compromise performance and reliability.<br><br>Warranty<br><br>The use of new parts is consistent with the vehicle factory warranty and extended warranty programs.<br><br>In summary new GM parts remain General Motors recommendation for repairs involving <a href="0.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/Air%20Bag/">air bags</a> systems and components. <a href="0.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/">Air bag systems</a> can best be returned to appropriate levels of performance when new GM parts are used.<br><br>(This information is also available online at: www.techinfo.gmgoodwrench.com.)<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
