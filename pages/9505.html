<h1>Antilock Brake System Automated Bleed Procedure</h1><br><br><b>Antilock Brake System Automated Bleed Procedure</b><br><b>Caution:</b>  Refer to <a href="318.html">Brake Fluid</a> Irritant Caution  (<a href="2622.html">Brake Fluid Irritant Caution</a>) .<br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Refer to <a href="318.html">Brake Fluid</a> Effects on Paint and Electrical Components Notice  (<a href="2623.html">Vehicle Damage Warnings</a>) .<br><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>Before performing the ABS Automated Bleed Procedure, first perform a pressure bleed of the base brake system. Refer to Hydraulic Brake System Bleeding (Pressure) </b> (<a href="328.html#Service%20and%20Repair/">Service and Repair</a>)<b>Hydraulic Brake System Bleeding (Manual) </b> (<a href="328.html#Service%20and%20Repair/">Service and Repair</a>)<b> . The automated bleed procedure is recommended when one of the following conditions exist:</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Base brake system bleeding does not achieve the desired pedal height or feel</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Extreme loss of <a href="318.html">brake fluid</a> has occurred</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Air ingestion is suspected in the secondary circuits of the brake modulator assembly</b><br><br><br><br><br>The ABS Automated Bleed Procedure uses a scan tool to cycle the system solenoid valves and run the pump in order to purge any air from the secondary circuits. These circuits are normally closed off, and are only opened during system initialization at vehicle start up and during ABS operation. The automated bleed procedure opens these secondary circuits and allows any air trapped in these circuits to flow out toward the brake corners.<br><br><br><br><b>Performing the Automated Bleed Procedure</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b>  The Auto Bleed Procedure may be terminated at any time during the process by pressing the EXIT button. No further Scan Tool prompts pertaining to the Auto Bleed procedure will be given. After exiting the bleed procedure, relieve bleed pressure and disconnect bleed equipment per manufacturers instructions. Failure to properly relieve pressure may result in spilled <a href="318.html">brake fluid</a> causing damage to components and painted surfaces.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise and support the vehicle.
