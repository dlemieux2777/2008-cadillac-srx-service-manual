<h1>Audio System Troubleshooting Hints</h1><br><br><b>Audio System Troubleshooting Hints</b><br><br>Several conditions that affect radio operation may be addressed without removing the radio from the vehicle. Verify the condition exists, and follow the diagnostic procedures in order to isolate and correct the condition.<br><br><br><b>Preliminary Inspections</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b>  <b>When testing the audio system for poor reception or noise, the vehicle should be outside away from metal buildings and utility lines, with the hood and rear compartment closed.</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect for any aftermarket equipment that may have been installed on the vehicle. If aftermarket equipment is found disconnect it and check if the audio noise is still present.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the antenna connector and the antenna coaxial cable are clean and tight.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For reception concerns, first determine if the customer is within the listening area of the stations they are attempting to receive.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stations at the lower end of the FM band are more susceptible to audio noises than stations at the higher end.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the noise is only from one speaker check for the following before speaker replacement:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Isolate the noise using the J 39916-A  CD and Cassette Diagnostic Audio Kit.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Inspect the speaker connections to ensure they are clean and tight. Refer to Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a>) .<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Inspect for a loose or incorrectly installed speaker or surrounding trim. Loose trim can cause a buzz or flutter which sounds like a malfunctioning speaker.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition noise on the FM band may be an indication of an ignition system problem.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect that all vehicle grounds are clean, tight and free of corrosion.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the rear defogger grid lines for large breaks or dark spots.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the connections at the radio antenna module to ensure that they are clean and tight.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Compare the customers vehicle to another of similar model and audio system to determine if the condition is abnormal.<br><br><br><br><b>Identifying Concerns</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In order to isolate the source of the noise/poor reception, identify the ignition switch position that the concern is most noticeable:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch to the accessory position.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Turn ON the radio.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Seek up 88-108 FM then 550-1600 AM.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Record the number of valid radio stations where the tuner stops.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Repeat these steps with the ignition ON, and the engine OFF then again with the engine running.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Return the ignition switch to the position that the concern was most noticeable.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove fuses or circuit breakers one at a time until the noise has been eliminated.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Identify what systems or components are powered by the fuse.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Reinstall all fuses and circuit breakers.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Disconnect the components powered by the fuse one at a time until the concern has been eliminated.<br><br><br><br><b>Corrective Action</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the ground integrity of the component or system causing the noise.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Malfunctioning and marginal components such as relays and solenoids may cause noise and/or poor reception.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always use a braided ground strap when applying additional grounds and keep the ground strap as short as possible.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the noise source is found to be coming from the vehicle harness: <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Route the <a href="3995.html">antenna cable</a> separately from the wire harness that is emitting the noise. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Use aluminum or nickel tape in order to shield the <a href="3995.html">antenna cable</a>.
