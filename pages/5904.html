<h1>Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancing - Off Vehicle</h1><br><br><b>Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancing - Off Vehicle</b><br><br><b>Caution:</b>  Failure to adhere to the following precautions before tire balancing can result in personal injury or damage to components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean away any dirt or deposits from the inside of the <a href="3624.html">wheels</a>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove any stones from the tread.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wear eye protection.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use coated weights on aluminum <a href="3624.html">wheels</a>.<br><br><br><br><br><b>Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancer Calibration</b><br><br>Tire and wheel balancers can drift out of calibration over time, or can become inaccurate as a result of heavy use. There will likely not be any visual evidence that a calibration problem exists. If a balancer is not calibrated within specifications, and a tire and wheel assembly is balanced on that machine, the assembly may actually be imbalanced.<br><br><br>Tire and wheel assembly balancer calibration should be checked approximately every 2 weeks, if the machine is used frequently, and/or whenever the balance readings are questionable.<br><br><br><b>Tire and Wheel Assembly Balancer Calibration Test</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>If the balancer fails any of the steps in this calibration test, the balancer should be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. If the balancer cannot be calibrated, contact the manufacturer for assistance.</b><br><br><br><br>Check the calibration of the tire and wheel assembly balancer according to the manufacturer's recommendations, or perform the following test.<br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/757917520.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Spin the balancer without a wheel or any of the adapters on the shaft.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the balancer readings.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Zero within 7 g (1/4 oz)</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the balancer is within the specification range, balance a tire and wheel assembly - that is within radial and lateral runout tolerances - to ZERO, using the same balancer.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the tire and wheel assembly has been balanced, add an 85 g (3 oz) test weight to the wheel at any location.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Spin the tire and wheel assembly again.

The wheel balance weights (2) are positioned on the wheel in order to offset the effects of a heavy spot (3). <a href="3624.html">Wheels</a> that have dynamic imbalance have a tendency to move from side to side and can cause an action called shimmy.<br><br>Most off-vehicle balancers are capable of checking both types of balance simultaneously.<br><br><br>As a general rule, most vehicles are more sensitive to static imbalance than to dynamic imbalance; however, vehicles equipped with low profile, wide tread path, high performance <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> and <a href="3624.html">wheels</a> are susceptible to small amounts of dynamic imbalance. As little as 14-21 g (1/2-3/4 oz) imbalance is capable of inducing a vibration in some vehicle models.<br><br><br><b>Balancing Procedure</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>When balancing tire and wheel assemblies, use a known good, recently calibrated, off-vehicle, two-plane dynamic balancer set to the finest balance mode available.</b><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise and support the vehicle.
