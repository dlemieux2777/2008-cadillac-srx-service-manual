<h1>Scheduled Maintenance</h1><br><br><b>SCHEDULED <a href="0.html#Maintenance/">MAINTENANCE</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To maintain the ride, handling, and performance of your vehicle, it is important that the first tire rotation service be performed when the vehicle has 5,000 to 8,000 miles (8 000 to 13 000 km). Check <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> for inflation pressures and wear. Rotate tires.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the "CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON" message comes on, it means that service is required for your vehicle. Have your vehicle serviced as soon as possible within the next 600 miles (1 000 km). It is possible that, if you are driving under the best conditions, the engine oil life system may not indicate that vehicle service is necessary for over a year. However, the engine oil and filter must be changed at least once a year and at this time the system must be reset.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the engine oil life system is ever reset accidentally, you must service your vehicle within 3,000 miles (5 000 km) since your last service. Remember to reset the oil life system whenever the oil is changed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the "CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON" message appears, the following services, checks, and inspections are required:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Change engine oil and filter.

Add fluid if needed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect engine air cleaner filter or change indicator (if equipped). If necessary, replace filter. If you drive regularly under dusty conditions, inspect the filter at each engine oil change.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> for inflation pressures and wear. If rotation is recommended for your vehicle, rotate tires.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect brake system. Visually inspect brake lines and hoses for proper hook-up, binding, leaks, cracks, chafing, etc. Inspect disc brake pads for wear and rotors for surface condition. Inspect other brake parts, including calipers, parking brake, etc.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check engine coolant and windshield washer fluid levels and add fluid as needed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Perform any needed additional services. Refer to "Additional Required Services".<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect suspension and steering components. Visually inspect front and rear suspension and steering system for damaged, loose, or missing parts, signs of wear or lack of lubrication. Inspect power steering lines and hoses for proper hook-up, binding, leaks, cracks, chafing, etc. Visually check constant velocity joints, rubber boots, and axle seals for leaks.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect engine cooling system. Visually inspect hoses and have them replaced if they are cracked, swollen, or deteriorated. Inspect all pipes, fittings, and clamps; replace with genuine parts as needed. To help ensure proper operation, a pressure test of the cooling system and pressure cap and cleaning the outside of the radiator and air conditioning condenser is recommended at least once a year.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect wiper blades. Inspect wiper blades for wear, cracking, or contamination. Clean the windshield and wiper blades, if contaminated. Replace wiper blades that are worn or damaged.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect restraint system components. Make sure the safety belt reminder light and safety belt assemblies are working properly. Look for any other loose or damaged safety belt system parts. If you see anything that might keep a safety belt system from doing its job, have it repaired. Have any torn or frayed safety belts replaced.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lubricate body components. Lubricate all key lock cylinders, hood latch assembly, secondary latch, pivots, spring anchor, release pawl, rear compartment hinges, outer tailgate handle pivot points, latch bolt, fuel door hinge, and folding seat hardware. More frequent lubrication may be required when exposed to a corrosive environment. Applying silicone grease on weatherstrips with a clean cloth will make them last longer, seal better, and not stick or squeak.</div>
