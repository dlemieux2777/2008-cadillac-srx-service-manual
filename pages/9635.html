<h1>Owner's Manual Tire Pressure Sensor Learn</h1><br><br><b>TPMS Sensor Matching Process</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Each TPMS sensor has a unique identification code. Any time you rotate your vehicle's tires or replace one or more of the TPMS sensors, the identification codes will need to be matched to the new tire/wheel position. The sensors are matched to the tire/wheel positions in the following order: driver side front tire, passenger side front tire, passenger side rear tire, and driver side rear tire using a TPMS diagnostic tool. See your dealer/retailer for service.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The TPMS sensors can also be matched to each tire/wheel position by increasing or decreasing the tire's air pressure. If increasing the tire's air pressure, do not exceed the maximum inflation pressure indicated on the tire's sidewall.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To decrease air-pressure out of a tire you can use the pointed end of the valve cap, a pencil-style air pressure gage, or a key.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>You have two minutes to match the first tire/wheel position, and five minutes overall to match all four tire/wheel positions. If it takes longer than two minutes, to match the first tire and wheel, or more than five minutes to match all four tire and wheel positions the matching process stops and you need to start over.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The TPMS sensor matching process is outlined below:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Set the parking brake.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the <a href="0.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Starting%20System/Ignition%20Switch/">ignition switch</a> to ON/RUN with the engine off.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) transmitter's lock and unlock buttons at the same time for approximately five seconds. The horn sounds twice to signal the receiver is in relearn mode and TIRE LEARNING ACTIVE message displays on the DIC screen.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start with the driver side front tire.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the valve cap from the valve cap stem. Activate the TPMS sensor by increasing or decreasing the tire's air pressure for five seconds, or until a horn chirp sounds. The horn chirp, which may take up to 30 seconds to sound, confirms that the sensor identification code has been matched to this tire and wheel position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Proceed to the passenger side front tire, and repeat the procedure in Step 5.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Proceed to the passenger side rear tire, and repeat the procedure in Step 5.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Proceed to the driver side rear tire, and repeat the procedure in Step 5. The horn sounds two times to indicate the sensor identification code has been matched to the driver side rear tire, and the TPMS sensor matching process is no longer active. The TIRE LEARNING ACTIVE message on the DIC display screen goes off.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the <a href="0.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Starting%20System/Ignition%20Switch/">ignition switch</a> to LOCK/OFF.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Set all four tires to the recommended air pressure level as indicated on the Tire and Loading Information label.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Put the valve caps back on the valve stems.</div>
