<h1>Radio/Audio System Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Radio/Audio System Description and Operation</b><br><br>The Entertainment System on this vehicle is configured with either a base or an uplevel system. Both the base and uplevel systems contain a radio, antenna, speakers, and an audio amplifier. Satellite digital radio (U2K) is optional for all radio levels (U.S. only).<br><br><br>The following list shows the radios available for this vehicle:<br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Base Radio (U2R) - AM/FM, CD, RDS, and Delco <a href="4279.html">Amplifier</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Uplevel Radio (U2S) - AM/FM, CD, RDS, and BOSE(R) Amplifier<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Uplevel Radio (U2V) - AM/FM, ICDX, RDS, Navigation, and BOSE(R) Amplifier (U.S. and Canada)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Uplevel Radio (U2X) - AM/FM, ICDX, RDS, Navigation, and BOSE(R) <a href="4279.html">Amplifier</a> (Japan)<br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/675824117.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br>Each item in the list below represents topics covered in detail below.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>AM/FM Reception<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>XM Reception<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Diversity Antenna System<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Audio Amplifier<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Theft Deterrent<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>CD Changer<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Radio Personalization w/Home and Away Feature<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Radio Data System (RDS)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>XM Satellite Radio<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>XM Advisory Messages<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Steering Wheel Controls<br><br><br><br><b>AM/FM Reception</b><br><br><b>Radio Signal</b><br><br>The radio signal is sent from a broadcast station and is then received by an antenna. The strength of the signal received depends on the following: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The power output (wattage) of the broadcasting station<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The location of the vehicle (or receiver) relative to the broadcast tower.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Obstacles between the tower and the receiver<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Atmospheric conditions<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>What band (AM or FM) the station is broadcasting<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Type of antenna and the ground plane<br><br><br><b>AM Reception</b><br><br>The AM band has a lower frequency range than the FM band. These longer wavelengths:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Bend around Obstacles<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Follow the curvature of the earth<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>May reflect off the ionosphere (skip)<br><br><br>The AM frequencies have longer range due to the ground wave. The ground wave follows the curvature of the earth and is affected by its conductivity. Greater conductivity equates to less signal loss thus transmission over water is better than over land. The AM band has a range of 80-320 km (50-200 miles).<br><br><b>FM Reception</b><br><br>The shorter wavelengths of the higher frequency FM band:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Reflect off obstacles<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Are absorbed by the ground<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Penetrate the ionosphere<br><br><br>Broadcasts in the FM band are limited to line of sight reception which is typically 40 km (25 miles). Even when out of a direct line of sight, the signal may be reflected into areas that would be in a shadow otherwise. Factors which affect the line of sight include:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Height of the broadcast antenna<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Height of the receiving antenna<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Terrain and buildings in the broadcast path<br><br><br><br><b>XM Reception</b><br><br>XM satellite radio provides digital radio reception. The XM signal is broadcast from two satellites and, where necessary, terrestrial repeaters. The high power satellites allow the antenna to receive the XM signal even when foliage and other partial obstructions block the antennas view of the satellite. Terrestrial repeaters are used in dense urban areas. These repeaters will receive the satellite signal and re-broadcast them at much higher power levels in order to ensure reception in areas with densely packed tall buildings.<br><br><br><b>Viewing XM Messages</b><br><br>To view the XM information messages, perform the following steps: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the TUNE/SEL knob to enter the main menu.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the TUNE/SEL knob until Clock/Information Display appears on the display.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the TUNE/SEL knob to select. The last message will be displayed.<br><br><br><br><b>Diversity Antenna System</b><br><br>The diversity antenna system uses both left and right rear quarter windows with an applique to the rear glass. Any damage to the antenna requires replacing the glass. <br><br><br>A diversity antenna system is designed to deliver the best radio signal reception possible. Two antennas are used to form a diversity system. The primary antenna is part of the passenger rear quarter window. This antenna receives both AM and FM signals. The secondary antenna is part of the driver rear quarter window and receives only FM signals for the audio system. RFA signals are also received by this antenna module. <br><br><br>The antenna reception signals are sorted out by the radio antenna modules. The radio antenna modules are enabled when the radio is turned on. When the AM or FM band is selected on the radio, the antenna modules connects the rear window antenna directly to the radio. In addition, when the FM band is selected an enable signal is sent to the passenger antenna module. Superimposed on this enable signal is the strength of the signal being received by the radio tuner. The antenna module performs two functions. It switches between the front and rear antennas, monitoring the radio signal strength and combines both signals and phase aligns them to create one strong signal. <br><br><br>The driver antenna module receives the FM2 signal from the left rear quarter glass and passes this signal to the passenger antenna module. The driver antenna module also receives the RFA and TPM signals and passes them via class 2 to the appropriate module. The passenger antenna module receives the FM1 signal from the right rear quarter glass where it then combines the two signals to be sent to the radio via coax. The passenger antenna module is powered by the driver antenna module via the FM2 signal coax. The FM composite signal from the radio provides feedback of signal quality to the passenger antenna module. This signal is 5-8 volts when in FM mode and 0v when in AM.<br><br><br><b>Audio Amplifier</b><br><br>The radio supplies low level audio signals to the audio amplifier in order to boost the signal sent to the speakers. <br><br><br>The radio uses the antenna input signal to create a stereo audio output signal, which is sent at the user-defined volume level to the audio amplifier. The audio amplifier amplifies the signal and sends it to the appropriate speakers. Tone, balance and fade information is sent by the radio to the audio amplifier via the class 2 communication circuit. Additional output processing is provided by the noise-canceling microphone. The microphone monitors interior ambient noise allowing the audio amplifier to modify the audio output. This maintains the sound at an enjoyable level.<br><br><br><b>Theft Deterrent</b><br><br><b>Radio</b><br><br>The Theftlock theft deterrent system is a feature on all base and uplevel radios. There is no need to program a security code into the radio as in past model years. The theft deterrent system now utilizes class 2 serial data to determine if the radio is in the appropriate vehicle. Each time the radio receives the run power mode message, it compares the VIN information it has stored to the VIN information received from the dash integration module (DIM) on the class 2 serial data circuit. If a mis-match occurs, the radio display will indicate to the user the radio is locked. Once this takes place, a DTC will set, the radio will not respond to any button presses and become inoperative. The two scenarios able to cause this condition are:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A radio is installed from another vehicle<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The DIM is replaced and not properly setup with the correct VIN information for that vehicle<br><br><br>The only way to unlock the radio is by using a scan tool. Always refer to the table in this section to diagnose the Theftlock DTC for further information.<br><br><b>Digital <a href="4282.html">Radio Receiver</a></b><br><br>The digital <a href="4282.html">radio receiver</a> utilizes class 2 serial data to determine if it is in the appropriate vehicle. Each time the digital radio receiver receives the run power mode message, it compares the VIN information received from the dash integration module (DIM) on the class 2 serial data circuit. If a mis-match occurs, the radio display will indicate to the user the digital radio receiver is locked. The digital radio receiver cannot be unlocked, it must be replaced. The two scenarios able to cause this condition are:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A digital <a href="4282.html">radio receiver</a> is installed from another vehicle<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The DIM is replaced and not properly setup with the correct VIN information for that vehicle<br><br><br><br><b>CD Changer</b><br><br>For the uplevel system the CD changer is the main audio gateway. It routes the audio from the source to the audio amplifier.<br><br><br>The radio controls and communicates with the CD changer via the class 2 communication circuit. The CD changer allows for multiple compact discs to be played continuously without having to manually change compact discs. To load multiple CDs, press the LOAD button for more than 3 seconds, then insert the CDs one at a time into the slot below the radio. CDs must be loaded with the label side up. If a disc is loaded label side down, the disc will not play and an error will occur. To eject a single CD press and release the EJECT button. To eject multiple CDs, press and hold the EJECT button for at least 3 seconds. When a CD is loaded in the CD changer the CD symbol will appear on the radio display.<br><br><br><b>Radio Personalization w/ Home and Away Feature</b><br><br>This feature allows two different drivers to store and recall specific radio settings. The settings recalled by the radio are determined by which remote keyless entry (RKE) transmitter (1 or 2) is used to enter the vehicle. The number on the back of the RKE transmitter corresponds to driver 1 or driver 2. The radio settings automatically adjust to where they were last set by the identified driver. <br><br><br>The radio can store home and away presets. Home and away presets allow you to use one set of preset radio settings in the area where you live, and another set when you go out of town. You do not need to reprogram your presets every time you travel. To change between home and away presets, perform the following steps:<br><br><br><b>w/U2R or U2S</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the TUNE/SEL knob.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the TUNE/SEL knob until H/A HOME PRESETS is displayed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the TUNE/SEL knob to change.<br><br><br><br><b>w/U2V, U2Y, or U2X</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pres the Audio Setup button.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the HOME/AWAY button.<br><br><br><br><b>Configurable Radio Display Keys w/U2R or U2S</b><br><br>The soft keys on either side of the display can be programmed for different functions.

RDS is a system that sends data along with the audio of the FM station you are currently tuned to. RDS is a standard that defines how a FM broadcast station may send digital data along with the audio program. Think of it as a one-way wireless modem, allowing the broadcaster to send information about his program to your receiver.<br><br><br>RDS data is carried in what is known as a "subcarrier". A subcarrier is a frequency that the FM broadcaster is authorized to use to send data or other audio programs that are not audible in the main audio program. RDS information can be used to display program information and to control the radio.<br><br><br>To receive the RDS signal, all that is needed is an FM receiver with an RDS circuit. A special integrated circuit capable of dealing with the RDS signal is in the RDS circuit and passes it along to the receiver's microprocessor where it is decoded and acted upon.<br><br><br><b>RDS Basic Information</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>RDS functions are provided in the FM broadcast band only.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>RDS functions will only work with FM broadcast stations that are broadcasting RDS data.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Not all FM Broadcast stations broadcast RDS data or offer all of the RDS services.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>RDS functions may not work properly when reception is weak, reception is of poor quality, or RDS is not implemented properly by the FM Broadcaster.<br><br><br>In some cases, a radio station broadcasting incorrect information may cause the RDS features of the radio to appear to work improperly.<br><br><br>Broadcast RDS information can be used in a variety of ways by the receiver and listener, but basically falls into two categories: Display and Control.<br><br><b>Displaying Program Information</b><br><br>RDS displays textual information such as:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The name of the station.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The type of program.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>General information such as artist and song title, call in phone numbers, etc.<br><br><br><b>RDS Traffic Feature (TA) w/U2R or U2S</b><br><br>This feature allows the radio to receive traffic announcements even with the volume muted, or when a CD or cassette is playing.
