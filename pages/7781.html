The area of accident damage is defined as the portion of the vehicle which is crushed, bent, or damaged due to a collision. An example of this would be a moderate collision where the front of the vehicle impacts a tree. If the vehicle has an SIR sensor mounted forward of the radiator, it must be replaced.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Replace the sensor whether or not the <a href="0.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/Air%20Bag/">air bags</a> have deployed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Replace the sensor even if it appears to be undamaged.<br><br><br>Sensor damage which is not visible, such as slight bending of the mounting bracket or cuts in the wire insulation, can cause improper operation of the SIR/<a>side air bag</a> sensing system. Do not try to determine whether the sensor is undamaged, replace the sensor. Also, if you follow a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) table and a malfunctioning sensor is indicated, replace the sensor.<br><br></div>
