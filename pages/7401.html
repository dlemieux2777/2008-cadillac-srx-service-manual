As vehicle speed increases, centrifugal force closes the sensors internal roll switch, which puts the sensor into Rolling mode. The remote control door lock receiver (RCDLR) receives and translates the data contained in the tire pressure sensor RF transmissions into sensor presence, sensor mode, and tire pressure. Once vehicle speed is greater than 40km/h (25 mph), the RCDLR waits for the sensors to go into rolling mode. If one or more sensors do not go into rolling mode, or do not transmit at all, the RCDLR will set DTC C0750, C0755, C0760, or C0765 respectively.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br>Vehicle speed is greater than 40 km/h (25 mph).<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A sensor does not transmit for 18 minutes. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A sensor low battery condition.<br><br><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The tire pressure monitor indicator icon on the instrument panel cluster (IPC) flashes for 1 minute and then remains illuminated after the ignition switch is cycled ON and the IPC bulb check is complete. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If equipped, the driver information center (DIC) displays the suspect tire pressure as dashes. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If equipped, the DIC displays a service tire monitor type message. <br><br><br><br><b>Conditions for Clearing the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A current DTC will clear when the malfunction is no longer present and 1 ignition cycle occurs. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The RCDLR automatically clears the history DTC when a current DTC is not detected in 100 consecutive drive cycles. <br><br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Some aftermarket wheel valve stem holes are located further from the wheel rim than original equipment wheels. When using the TPM special tool to activate a sensor, ensure the tool antenna is no further than 15 cm (6 in) from the sensor and is aiming upward. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Aftermarket wheel valve stem locations can cause a sensor to not function correctly.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A sensor may have been damaged due to a previous wheel/tire service or flat tire event.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The use of tire sealants can obstruct the sensor pressure sensing port and cause inaccurate tire pressure readings. If this condition is verified, remove the sealer from the tire and replace the sensor. Refer to Tire Pressure Indicator Sensor Replacement (Snap In Style)  (<a href="7918.html">Tire Pressure Indicator Sensor Replacement (Snap In Style)</a>) .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Occasionally sensor transmissions are not received by the RCDLR due to vehicle level RF interference from items such as but not limited to aftermarket ignition systems, DVD players, CB radios, or metallic type window tinting. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The sensor activation procedure may have to be repeated up to 3 times before determining a sensor is malfunctioning. In the event a particular sensor's information is displayed on the special tool upon activation but the horn does not chirp, it may be necessary to rotate the wheel valve stem to a different position due to the RF signal is being blocked by another component.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Occasionally sensors can become mislocated due to previous tire rotations where the sensor learn procedure was not performed or stray sensor transmissions have been received from other vehicles . Always learn the sensors to ensure the DTC set is for that actual physical corner of the vehicle. Refer to Tire Pressure Sensor Learn  (<a href="0.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a>) . <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A sensor low battery condition will set a sensor DTC but will not illuminate the low tire pressure indicator or display a message on the DIC, if equipped. The sensor battery condition can be verified in the scan tool RCDLR data list. If a sensor low battery condition is indicated on the scan tool, the sensor will need to be replaced.
