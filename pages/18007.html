<h1>Fuel - GM's Position On Use Of E 15, 2007 Newer Vehicles</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>10-06-04-015<br><br><b>Date: </b>December 08, 2010<br><br><b>Subject: </b> General Motors' Position Regarding Use of E15 in Model Year 2007 and Newer Vehicles<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2007-2011 GM Passenger Cars and Trucks <br><br>General Motors' position regarding the Environmental Protection Agency announcement allowing the use of E 15 in 2007 and newer vehicles: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>General Motors' remains focused on securing a safe and positive driving experience for our customers. GM believes that the waiver decision by the EPA regarding E 15 could lead to confusion for consumers as to what fuel their vehicle should use. In response, we will continue to encourage our customers to refer to their vehicle Owner Manual for proper fuel designation. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>The vehicle Owner Manual specifies that fuels containing more than 10 percent ethanol should not be used in GM vehicles that do not have a flex fuel designation. </b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>GM has the largest fleet of flex fuel vehicles on the road today (over 4 million in the U.S.) and these vehicles can safely use ethanol blends of up to 85 percent ethanol. So blends of E 15 (15 percent ethanol), as in the partial waiver announced, are appropriate for these vehicles. However, ethanol blends greater than E 10 should not be used in GM vehicles that do not have a flex fuel designation as they are not designed and certified to run on gasoline consisting of more than 10 percent ethanol-blend volume to avoid any unintended consequences, as per: their Owner Manual. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>We believe biofuels, especially E 85 ethanol, are an effective near-term solution to reduce petroleum dependence and the carbon footprint of driving. As the global leader in producing vehicles designed to handle ethanol blends from E 0 to E 85, GM offers 19 flexible-fuel vehicles for the 2011 model year. <br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/DM13Q313/gm70/57044812.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
