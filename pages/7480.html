Fuel delivery is controlled differently during Open Loop and Closed Loop (CL). During Open Loop, the ECM determines fuel delivery based on sensor signals without heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) input. During CL, the ECM adds HO2S inputs and level of purge to calculate the short and long term fuel trim (FT) adjustments. If the HO2S indicates a lean condition, the fuel trim values will be above 0 percent. If the HO2S indicates a rich condition, the FT values will be below 0 percent. The short term FT values change rapidly in response to the HO2S voltage signals. The long term FT makes coarse adjustments in order to maintain an optimum air/fuel ratio. A block of memory cells contain information arranged in combinations of engine RPM and engine load for a full range of vehicle operating conditions. The long term FT diagnostic is based on an average of cells currently being used. The ECM selects the cells based on the engine speed and load. The FT diagnostic will conduct a test to determine if a rich failure actually exists or if excessive vapor from the evaporative emission (EVAP) canister is causing a rich condition.<br><br><br>If the ECM detects an excessively lean condition, DTC P0171 or P0174 sets. If the ECM detects an excessively rich condition, DTC P0172 or P0175 sets.<br><br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0050, P0056, P0059, P0060, P0068, P0101, P0102, P0103, P0107, P0108, P0112, P0113, P0120, 0122, P0123, P0128, P0151, P0152, P0153, P0154, P0155, P0157, P0158, P0160, P0201-P0208, P0220, P0222, P0223, P0300, P0301-P0308, P0442, P0443, P0446, P0449, P0451, P0452, P0453, P0454, P0455, P0496, P0506, P0507, P1153, P1516, P2101, P2119, P2120, P2125, P2135, P2138, P2A03, P2A04 are not set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine is in CL status.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Fuel Trim Learn is enabled.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine coolant temperature (ECT) is between -38 and +150&deg;C (-36.4 and +302&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The intake air temperature (IAT) is between -38 and +150&deg;C (-36.4 and +302&deg;F).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The manifold absolute pressure (MAP) is between 5-255 kPa (0.7-36.9 psi).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed is less than 134 km/h (83 mph).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine speed is between 400-6,000 RPM.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The mass air flow (MAF) is between 0.5-510 g/s.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The barometric pressure (BARO) is more than 70 kPa (10.1 psi).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel level is more than 10 percent.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC P0174 or P0175 runs continuously when the above conditions have been met.<br><br><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The long term FT weighted average value is more or less than a calibrated value.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The above condition is present for approximately 3 minutes after the Conditions for Running the DTC have been met.<br><br><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br>The control module records the operating conditions at the time the diagnostic fails.
