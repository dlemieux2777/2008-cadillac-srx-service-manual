<h1>Power Seats System Description and Operation (Front Seat)</h1><br><br><b>Power Seats System Description and Operation (Front Seat)</b><br><br>The driver and passenger power seat systems each consist of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat adjuster switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lumbar switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat horizontal motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat front vertical motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat rear vertical motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat recline motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lumbar horizontal motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>PWR SEATS circuit breaker 30 A<br><br><br><br><b>Seat Adjuster Switch</b><br><br>The seat adjuster and lumbar switches provide both power and ground to the selected seat and lumbar motors. Battery positive voltage is supplied at all times to the driver and passenger seat adjuster switches from the PWR SEATS circuit breaker located in the left rear fuse block. The driver seat adjuster switch is grounded through the switch ground circuit and G200. While the passenger seat adjuster switches are grounded through the switch ground circuit and G201.<br><br><br><b>Motors</b><br><br>All of the seat motors operate independently of each other. Each motor contains an electronic circuit breaker (PTC) that opens in the event of a circuit overload and will reset only after voltage has been removed from the circuit. There are four seat position motors and one lumbar motor. These are the horizontal motor, front vertical motor, rear vertical motor, <a href="4949.html">seat back</a> recline motor and the lumbar horizontal motor. The seat horizontal motor moves the entire seat forward and rearward. The seat vertical motors may operate independently to tilt the front or rear of the <a href="4951.html">seat cushion</a> up or down. Both motors can also run simultaneously to move the entire seat up or down. The recline motor moves the angle of the seat back forward or rearward and the lumbar horizontal motor moves the lumbar support forward and rearward.<br><br><br><b>Seat Operation</b><br><br>All motors are reversible. For example, when the seat switch is operated to moved the entire seat forward, battery positive voltage is applied through the horizontal forward switch contacts and the seat horizontal forward switch control circuit to the seat horizontal motor. The motor is grounded through the horizontal motor rearward switch contacts and the horizontal motor rearward control circuit to the motor. The motor runs in order to drive the entire seat forward until the switch is released. Moving the entire seat rearward works similarly to moving the entire seat forward, except that battery positive voltage and ground are applied on opposite circuits causing the motor to run in the opposite direction. All other seat and lumbar motors are also powered this way.<br><br></div>
